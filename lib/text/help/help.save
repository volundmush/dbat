ABSORB
----------

   Absorb is an ability that absorb model androids as well as bio-androids have.
They way they go about absorbing is different though. Bio-androids absorb
targets permanantly for a permanant gain. The target they absorb dies once
absorbed(if they didn't manage to break free). Absorb model androids absorb ki
and stamina from a victim. They have a chance to increase their pl/ki/st
permanantly while absorbing but their main gain is refilling their current ki/st.

Bio-androids: Get 3 absorbs period. Use them wisely.
Bio-android absorb syntax: absorb (extract | swallow) (target)

   Extract being small gains that can be prefromed infinitely as long as you are
not softcapped, and swallow being a larger gain that has a limited number of
uses period.

ADMINLEVEL
----------

Access to administrative commands is no longer a function of level, but rather
a function of ADMIN flags. The following admin levels are in use:

0 - Mortal (none)
1 - Immortal
2 - Builder
3 - Admin
4 - Senior Admin
5 - Implementor

These are set via: set <character> adminlevel <value>
If you wish to remove admin powers from someone, set them to adminlevel 0.
#1
ADRENALINE
----------

   Adrenaline is possessed by most biological creatures known to civilization
(in varying amounts) but Arlians in particular possess the ability to control
their advanced adrenal glands. This allows them to convert stamina into
powerlevel or ki whenever they need to. The trade is an exact 1:1 ratio with
zero chance of failure.

Syntax: adrenaline (pl - ki) (percent)
Example: adrenaline pl 10

ADVANCE
----------

Usage: advance <victim> <level>

ADVANCE moves a player to a new level.  If used to promote a player to an
immortal level, and if you have the autowiz program installed, the wizlist and
immlist will automatically be recreated.

Example:

  > advance rasmussen 34

AEDIT
----------

Usage: ADEIT <social>.

This allows you to create new actions (socials), and edit values for existing 
socials.  Values that can be edited in this process are either those that 
control the command operation (minimum character level and position, sort
order in the command table, etc), or the resulting messages that are send to
the character issuing the command, others in the same room, and the command
victim.  These messages can use substitution parameters as per the act() 
function, which is described in greater detail in the documentation "The
act() Function" included as part of the stock CircleMUD release.

AFTERLIFE DEAD DEATH HELL
----------

   These are the places you go when you die. Don't fret though friend, even
though death is a harsh mistress you can find a way to escape her grasp. There
are two paths to revival in Al/Hell depending on your alignment. Though you
will have to wait at a variable amount of real life hours before you are revived
even if you complete these 'quests' to earn your life anew. King Yemma may know
how to get you started. 

   You can also be wished back with the Dragon balls. If someone with them
cares enough to wish you back.

ALIAS ALIASES
----------

Usage: alias [alias name] [command]

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
  > killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

@RIf you save your character aliases will be saved.@n

ALIGNMENT GOOD EVIL NEUTRAL
----------

@CAlignments in Advent Truth@n

@YGood@n
Someone who is good generally does good things. It's fairly simple. You don't
murder people for no reason. You generally don't steal from people for no
reason. You should generally attempt to right wrongs and help out if it is
within your means to do so. At the least, you will not enjoy it when bad
things happen to those that do not deserve it.

@DNeutral@n
Someone who is neutral believe that there is a balance that must be maintained
between good and evil in order for the universe to function. It is not as
simple as, @WOh hey, I'm neutral... I can do whatever I want! @n Being neutral
means that you honor the system of the universe and its balance over the
individuals in it, more or less.

@REvil@n
Being evil in general means that you do not respect life or the beliefs of
others. You kill, steal, or do other evil acts. This is not an excuse to PK
anyone at any time. NPCs can be killed without much care, but player
characters should be special deaths that mean something in a storyline, and as
such, should have a good role play leading up to it.

ANDROID
----------

 Androids are robotic beings constructed artificially.  They are generally
strong with intelligence depending on their AI programming.  Some androids are
more cyborg than robotic, but most are completely robotic.  Some of the most
sophisticated androids built were created by Dr.  Gero.

   Android Models: The base abilities of an android are determined by their
model type. There are three model types; Absorb android, Repair androids, and
Sense androids. Absorb androids can not be upgraded, but have special
mechanisms built into their hands to absorb energy from other living beings. 
Repair androids can be upgraded, have the ability to repair, and the ability to
recharge their energy. Sense androids have the ability to perfectly sense a
target's location, and if up close their powerlevel. 

   Also sense androids can be upgraded, gain upgrade points faster than repair
droids, and start out with high powerlevel/ki/stamina. 

Race Classification: Power/Ability
Best Trainer: Android 16
Decent Trainer: You really should pick Android 16 for them.

ANSI COLOR
----------

Usage: color [off | brief | normal | complete]

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

  > color off
  This command disables all color.

  > color brief
  > color normal
  > color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

'color' with no argument will display your current color level.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.

The colorcode entry will show you what codes can be used to make what colors.

APPENDAGES LIMBS
----------

   Appendages are the arms, legs, and in some cases tails of a race. Looking at
someone can show the status of their limbs. For yourself it is best to check
status to view your appendages. Loss of appendages can happen if you are not
careful. This will affect you differently depending on which limb or how many
limbs you have lost. Not having arms will surely make manipulating objects and
using hand attacks impossible. No legs will make getting around difficult as
well. Losing your head will, well you can guess what that will do.

APPRAISE
----------

   Appraise is used to find out the value and possible bonuses an object
possesses. Just about every sensei teaches it as it is a valuable skill for any
warrior to have. It can also be used to see if an object is fake, or forged. 
Which is a good thing to look out for.

Syntax: appraise (obj)

   If you use appraise in a shop then you will not be able to appraise things
in your inventory. You will only be able to appraise things sold by that shop.

Syntax: appraise (obj name | obj num)

AQUA-BARRIER
----------

   Aqua Barrier is the Hydromancy version of a normal barrier. The user forms
a barrier of ki and a bubble of rapidly moving water. This barrier is superior
to the standard barrier in two variable ways. First outside of water it
reduces damage it receives by 15%. Inside water it reduces damage the barrier
receives by 25%. This increases the lasting power of the barrier. Not only
that but this form of barrier never disappears over time. It must be destroyed
by attacks or released by the user.

Syntax: barrier < 1-75 | release >

Arena
----------

   In game, is a specially built arena for the purposes of tournaments and
players fighting one another in non-lethal combat (but without sparring). To
get there, you must locate Tim the Scalper (In Nexus City) and buy a ticket,
then give that ticket to a special pilot at the Nexus City Starport.

   This arena is NOT the same as the World Martial Arts tournament arena found
elsewhere.

  You are able to watch fighters in the arena if you are close enough (In the
preparation room). These are the commands related to that function.

Syntax: arena (Fighter number)
        arena look

ARLIANS
----------

   Arlians are a sentient race of bug people. Their society as a whole lags
behind the average for the rest of the known worlds. Arlians are a hearty race
in general that are capable of adapting to live in most any environment. This
means of adaption is their primary defense against the hostile nature of the
home world.

   Arlians all have wings and are natural flyers as a result of this. The
males all have white clear wings that allow for faster movement when flying. 
The females have bright wings with various unique colors that are wider and
more energy efficient. As long as a female Arlian is exposed to solar
radiation (even at night) they are able to regenerate PL and Ki faster than
normal. 

Males: +50% Speed Index when Flying
Females: 4x PL/Ki Regen Speed Outside, 2x Stam Regen Speed Outside

ARMOR-INDEX
----------

   Armor Index is used to determine the level of protection your body has

ATTACH
----------

Builder's working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.

Usage: attach mob {trigger vnum/name} {mob name} [location]
       attach obj {trigger vnum/name} {obj name} [location]
       attach room {trigger vnum/name} {room vnum} [location]

   Attach lets you attach a script to one instance of a mob/obj/room, for
testing or other purposes. The command only attaches the script once,
and will not last over a reboot (or crash).

The 'location' is what number in the triggerlist the trigger will assume.
It is important to first attach a trigger to test before you manually add it
through oedit/medit/redit. 

Examples:
attach room 14500 14520 - Attaches room trigger 14500 to room 14520.
attach mob 1332 santa   - Attaches mob trigger 1332 to mob 1308 (santa).
attach obj 1480 sword   - Attaches obj trigger 1480 to a sword.

BADASS
----------

   Badass is a special hidden trait that is unlocked when certain specific
conditions are met. Earning this trait makes you a certifiable badass like
Iovan. There are two different conditions for earning Badass.

1) Reach level 100 with no positive traits. You aren't required to take negative traits, for this condition. The bonus for obtaining this version of badass is: 10 points applied to your desired stat (str/con/wis/agl/spd/int) OR a 20% increase to PL/KI/ST


2) Reach level 100 with full negative traits. This applies the badass traits mentioned in 1, whilst also NEGATING all negative trait penalties (you still keep the traits for RP reasons, but have overcome them enough to not suffer from them).

BAKUHATSUHA
----------

   Bakuhatsuha is a technique invented and made famous by the saiyan Nappa. 
The user takes their charged ki and rushes it out from their body destroying a
wide area. It is completely under the control of the user who can choose to
spare allies from its effect. Bakuhatsuha does full damage if only a single
target is within its blast area as the attack is focused more on the target. 
With two targets the damage is reduced to 75% to hit a wider area. With 3 it is
reduced further to 50%. With 4 or more it is reduced to 25% and reduces no
further for additional victims. As it is an area effect skill parry and block
are useless against it. Dodging and zanzoken are not however.

BAN UNBAN
----------

Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game.  You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site.  Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

 Bardock is the father of Goku and one of the strongest saiyan warriors before
the destruction of planet Vegeta.  However in Dragonball Advent Truth Vegeta
isn't destroyed.  Bardock excels in developing new techniques and has decided to
teach them to those who commit theirselves to his teaching.  The techniques he
teaches are mostly oriented around powerful ki attacks and very few special
techniques.

 Those who are bardock's students are immune to 10x gravity stamina costs for
fighting. Though exercising still works the same for them in this gravity as
any other sensei student type.

BARRIER
----------

   Barrier is a technique where you take charged ki and form a sphere of energy
around your body for protection. This sphere can absorb all damage as long as
it has the energy to do so. When a barrier runs out of energy it will burst.

BASH
----------

   Bash is unique physical attack that was developed by Arlians. It takes
advantage of their hard exoskeletons and is put to use by the Arlian slaming
their body into a target at full speed. This is the strongest physical attack
but it requires a lot of stamina to use and has a chance of knocking the user
down. It has an equal chance of knocking the target down as well.

Syntax: bash (target)

BEAM
----------

   Beam is a standard ki technique. Basicly it is an extended kiblast. Packs

BLESS
----------

   Bless is a technique used to increase the rate at which a target
regenerates. Generally a very good thing to use. Having someone around who
can perform bless will help any group get back into the fight faster. 

   A blessed character will also have a 66% chance for their equipment to be
saved from any damage when it would be damaged (which is a totally separate
roll) and if it happens to be damaged it only takes 1 damage instead of the
standard 2-5 percent. 

Syntax: focus bless (target)

BLOCK
----------

   This is a defensive skill that increases your chances of blocking an attack.
Blocked attacks do significantly less damage than unblocked attacks. While not
as helpful as dodging or parrying, blocking is still necessary to excel at. If
you fail to dodge or parry you will wish you were better at blocking...

   Block is also a command to attempt to prevent a target from being able to
leave the area. It will depend on the user's speed vs their target's, as well
as if the target is a good escape artist.

BOARDS

   Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD. 
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example, a
standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social" messages,
etc. Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all types of boards. 


   Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board. Type "WRITE
<subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with a '@@' as the
first character on a line. Type "READ <number>" to read a post. Type "REMOVE
<number>" to remove your own messages. 


   Type "VIEWORDER" to switch the order you view the board messages from either
newest at the top or newest at the bottom. 
Example:

CHANNELS NEWBIE OOC GRATS NONEWBIE NOOOC NOGRATS
----------

Usage: newbie <message>
       grats <message>
       ooc <message>

These are channels reserved for specific purposes.  Messages on these
channels reach everyone who is monitoring them. The newbie channel is
to be used to discuss newbie related questions ONLY. Nothing IC should
be brought up on it. Only generalized questions. For example no "I am
at blah blah how do I open this" instead this is the type of questions
allowed "How do I use blah blah command?". Nothing character specific
(this includes what the character should or should not know, ie. how
to open a specific door).

Examples:

  > newbie short sword -- minimum bid 100k
  > ooc Hey, is that a short sword on your belt or are you happy to see me?
  > grats LEVEL!!!!!!!!
  > grats GRATS CATJE!!!!!!!!

CHARGE
----------

   Charge is a command you use to charge your ki in preparation for the use of
ki attacks, as well as some other ki-based techniques. The command takes a
percentage argument. For example, if you have max ki of 10 million and @Rcharge
75@n, this will charge 7.5 million ki, but may be less if your current ki is
below the value. Your charged ki will gradually drain over time, when held.

   Charging too much ki can render you unable to move. This amount is
partially related to your concentration skill. Release the charged ki to be
able to move.

Syntax: charge <percent amount>
Syntax: charge release

CLAN-CONTROL
-----------
   Clan Control is a concept where a particular clan controls a planet. The
clan that controls a planet gets to choose a bonus that all their clan members
get to enjoy. As long as that clan controls a planet they get to keep that
free bonus. They can only get one bonus through control. Only good and evil
clans can control a planet as well. Because of this Neutral clans get to
purchase an extra bonus since they are unable to get one through control.

   Free Planet: In order to control a free planet (one not controlled) the clan
in question must complete 5 RP logs establishing their control. If these logs
contain clan vs clan content or a rival clan is also trying to gain control of
the free planet then the first one to earn a total of 100 RPP from said logs
will gain control of the area. What is RPed to gain control of the planet will
be scrutinized by RP judges to a finer degree than other RP logs. If the logs
in question either do not have enough clan members from the clan vying for
control or does not make sense to the planet then the log may be rejected
entirely.

   Controlled Planet: In order to free a planet from another clan the attacking
clan must complete 6 RP logs attacking 6 points of importance to that planet.
Read help POI for information on the points of importance for each planet.
Each RP log must be announced 5 days in advance before it is attempted. The
clan that controls the planet (from now refered to as the defending clan) must
respond with their intention to defend within that time period. Then they must
have some of their members present to defend. A passing RP log from the
attacking clan without opposition will get that POI automatically. Once all
six POI fall to the attacking clan then the planet comes under their control.
If the defending clan manages to win in a log involving a POI then the attack
on it fails.

   Controlling All Planets: If you control all the planets your clan and it's
members will be recorded in the hall of fame. The MUD will get to vote on
having a player wipe at that time. The members of the clan that controls all
the planets will get 2 votes each. Every other player in the game will get 1
vote each. If a pwipe is decided it will be carried out the week following the
vote.

CLANS
----------

   Clans are a grouping of players who function together in some roleplaying
purpose that their characters have agreed upon either spoken or unspokenly. 
Clan members should be loyal to their clan while they remain in it, though they
don't have to be. In fact a good roleplaying plot could be spying on a rival
clan by posing as a member of said clan.


   Clans also can offer protection and aid for their members. Getting new
members started out on the road of power, or providing muscle to fight off the
clan's enemies. In essence a clan is a good thing you should try to join. 
Standing alone may be badass, but it could be fatal.


   To aquire a clan you must meet the following requirements; Pay an immortal
90k zenni, have a total of 3 players willing to join it(including yourself), and
have a written clan purpose and roleplay background. If you have all this the
imm you pay will give you a clan pamphlet, set the leader of the clan(who can
handle the rest via the clan command), and then after you have reviewed the
pamphlet and paid for the various clanhall packages(you can wait till you have
the money to pay for them if needed) the imm and the clan leader will begin
construction of the clanhall of the clan.

                    @G-Clan Recruitment-@w
   Clan leaders can set their clan to either free or restricted in regards to
recruitment. Free means anyone can join using the clan join <clan name>
command while restricted means that people must apply and have their
application approved. Regardless of what setting a clan has adopted, you must
have obtained a minimum of 5 TRPP (Total Roleplay points) before you can join a
clan. 
                    @G-Clan Maintenance-@w
   1: Clans must have at least one clan related RPP posted per month that earns
at least 4 RPP. If they do not the clan will lose its right to exist.
   2: Clans can only have a maximum of 10 members unless there is at least one
other clan that has 10 members. 
   3: Every clan related RP posted by a clan (regardless of whether it involves
another clan or not) will have 1 RPP recorded for it in a pool. At the end of
the month every RPP in a clan's pool will be given to the leader of that clan
to distribute amongst its members.

CLASS
----------

Race Classification is a system for identifying the strengths and 
weaknesses of a particular race. All races in Dragonball Advent Truth
have pros and cons. This helpfile will explain what classifications
there are and what they in turn mean.

Power: A power race is a race that specializes mostly in high powerlevel
and stamina. A good example of a power race is saiyans which have the 
highest transformation threshhold.

Specialist: A Specialist race is a race that isn't that powerful, but
has specialized attributes that help it learn and perform techniques
with great skill. These races make up for their lack of brawn with their
understanding of technique.

Sage: A sage race has high ki rating and a greater talent with such
difficult skills as healing.

Ability: Ability races are not usually strong or talented, but have built
in or aquired abilities unique to their race. These abilities make up for
their other shortcomings.

   @wThe letters for the colors are to be preceded by a single @@@@ sign,
where the actual code will be @@@@<letter>. Double @@@@ will = single @@@@.
All use of colorcodes MUST be terminated with @@@@ n to restore normal color
to prevent color bleeding. If a color listed does not match the color you
see, then feel free to adjust the colors of your client to match. If you do
not then some color schemes may not appear the way they were intended.

COMBOS
----------

   Combos are possible when using physical attacks. You must wait for a
message that informs you that a combo is possible and what randomly selected
physical attack you need to use next to continue the combo. Each successive
combo hit will increase the damage of the next successful combo hit by 10%. 
This will continue up until your 20th combo hit which will do 5x damage for the
attack used.

   If you fail to use the attack requested or fail to do enough damage with an
attack then the combo chance will end.

   You must know the all of the following skills before a combo chance will be
offered. Punch, Kick, Knee, Elbow, Uppercut, Roundhouse, Heeldrop, and Slam.
You must also be using one of those skills for an offer to be made.

COMMENT * 
----------

* This is an example of a comment in trigedit. Because of the *'s the lines 
* are not parsed, so the script still works even if it has a lot of 
* explanations built in. All triggers should be heavily commented.

* The below line sends the text 'Trigger firing' to the room.

CONCENTRATION CONCENTRATE
----------

   Concentration is a skill that determines how quickly you can charge ki as
well as how fast you regen ki when resting.

   Concentration also controls the amount of ki you can have charged and still
be able to travel room to room. Below is a list of the concentration levels
and how much ki charged they will let you travel with. 
-------------------
Concentration Level: (100) Ki charged: (50%)
Concentration Level: (80) Ki charged: (40%)
Concentration Level: (70) Ki charged: (30%)
Concentration Level: (60) Ki charged: (20%)
Concentration Level: (Any) Ki charged: (1-19%)

CONSIDER
----------

Usage: consider <monster>

This command will compare your Level with the <monsters> level.  You will then
receive a rough estimate, which is by no means exact.  Consider does not take
hitpoints/special attacks/damage into account.

Example:

  > consider fido

#0
CONTEXT
----------

Usage: context number
* This little script will make sure one %has_said_hello% exist for each player.
context %actor.id%
set has_said_hello 1
global has_said_hello
* now only scripts running with context = %actor.id% can access this particular 
* variable. however - it's a better idea to use vars set on players: help remote.

   Changes the "context" of a script to this value. When first run, a script's 
context is 0. When a variable is made global, it is given the current context. 
When a variable is accessed, if it must be searched for globally, a "found" 
variable must either have context 0 or the current context. The net result of 
this is you may have many global variables in a single script, with the same 
name, differing only by context. Players may have variables; this mostly 
removes the need for variable context. Previously, a player's ID could be used 
as variable context to allow a script to service multiple players at once.

COOKING
----------

   Cooking is a skill used for cooking meat on a campfire. The higher the
skill in cooking the more successful you are at cooking it just right. Low
cooking skill will tend to ruin the meat completely very often. If you manage
to cook an edible portion and eat it then 5% of your powerlevel will be
restored for each one you eat. If you manage to cook a portion well it could
restore even more. All animals have meat on them when killed.

----------

   Create is a technique where the user focuses their ki and materializes an
object into being. How it works exactly is a mystery to all but those who

CRUSHER-BALL
----------

   Crusher ball is a technique invented by and made famous by Jeice of the Ginyu

CURSE
----------

   Curse is the technique used to reduce the rate at which a target
regenerates. This is good to use on any of your enemies, to slow their
recovery in case they happen to escape your clutches for a short period. 
Being cursed also prevents them from using any focus skills. 

   A cursed character will have their equipment take triple damage when it
happens to be damaged (worn equipment only).

DEATHBALL
----------

   Deathball is a technique invented by the Icerian Royal Family. It was made
most famous by Frieza. The user holds an arm above their head pointing upwards
with their index finger. Then their charged ki pools into an orb above that
finger which grows to a massive size. That large ball of energy is then sent
flying at a target. On critical hits it does four times damage instead of the
usual two. However since it is such a slow moving attack it has a lower than
normal chance of hitting its target.

DEATHBEAM
----------

   Deathbeam is a technique developed by the Icerian Royal Family. It was most
famously used by Frieza. The user takes their charged ki and swiftly channels
it from their index finger toward a target. While not overly powerful compared
to attacks as Kamehameha or Galik Gun, its greatest strength comes from its
speed. Deathbeam is fired so fast and with so little warning that it has a
higher chance to hit a target without them being able to defend theirself.

DETACH
----------

Builder's working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.   

Usage: detach [mob | obj] {target name} {trigger name/vnum | 'all'}
       detach room {target vnum | '.'} {trigger name/vnum | 'all'}

   Detach removes a script to one instance of a mob/obj/room, for testing or 
other purposes. The command only removes the trigger temporarily, until the
room/obj/mob is reloaded via reboot, zreset, load.

Use the optional arguments 'mob' and 'obj' to differentiate if more entities
with the same alias are in the room.

Examples:
detach room 14500 14520 - remove trigger 14500 from room 14520.
detach room all         - removes all triggers from a room.
detach santa 1332       - detach trigger 1332 from mob 1308 (santa).
detach mob santa all    - detach all triggers from Santa.
detach santa all        - Same as above.
detach sword 1300       - detach trigger 1300 from sword.
detach obj sword 1300   - You guessed it - same as above.
detach sword all        - detach all triggers from the sword.

DIMIZU-TORIDE TORIDE
----------

   Dimizu Toride is a Hydromancy technique that floods an entire area with a
cube of water. The water walls are structured in such a way that they maintain
the shape of the cube even if it is disturbed greatly. The cube will last
until the ki that was supplied to it is too weak to maintain the form. When
that happens the water will rush away and disappear. Anyone in the cube will
be unable to breath unless they are naturally capable of surviving underwater.

Syntax: dimizu

DISGUISE
----------

   Disguise is a skill used for... Well disguising yourself. The higher the
skill the higher the chance to pull a disguise off. You need something on your
head to even attempt it though. A disguised character can do things without
their identity being known. If you fight while disguised there is a chance your
disguise may come off, depending on your skill with disguises. So be careful of
that.

by Mercenary Tao, the Hermit's brother, but also by Chaotzu. This attack is
where charge ki is channeled to the index finger of the user and then fired at a
target in a moderatly sized beam. Slightly weaker in maximum strength compared
to a Kamehameha wave this attack carries the occasional effect of draining some
of a target's uncharged ki.

DRAGONBALLS
----------

 The dragonballs are seven mystical orbs created by Kami, and later Dende,
that summon the Eternal Dragon Shenron.  Once summoned two wishes may be asked
of Shenron.  While capable of fulfilling a great number of wishes there are some
wishes that exceed Shenron's ability to grant.  The dragonballs are loaded into
the mud in random locations across the the universe.  A change from the show for
simplicity's sake.  They can be found easier with a dragon radar if you happen
to be lucky enough to have one.  Other than that diligent searching is the only
other means.  Be careful when you go hunting for dragonballs, conflict is sure
to be found as well before Shenron is summoned.  Teamwork just may be your only
ticket to getting a wish.

   @RIf enough selfish wishes have been made then the Dragon Balls will crack and
explode due to the pressure of the selfish energy locked deep inside them. 
When this happens seven Shadow Dragons will be released. Only through
defeating them will the Dragon Balls be restored to the way they were. @n

DUAL-BEAM
----------

   Dual Beam is a technique only usable by androids. Channeling their charged
energy through circuits in their arms they are capable of firing two beams of
incredible speed right after each other. The process makes the most efficient
use of the available energy essentially getting twice the attack for the same
amount of energy of a single attack. The second attack is strained however and
has a 20% lower chance of hitting its intended target.

DUB NAME
----------

   Dub is a command used to name a target player character a specific name. 
This may be their real name, an unwitting fake name, a nickname, etc.

   Only the one doing the naming will see the name in question and be able to
target based on that name. This allows for the use of fake names by those who
do not wish their identity easily known as well as being more realistic. You
don't automatically know the names of everyone as if they were all wearing name
tags.

EMOTE
----------

   Emote is used to perform roleplaying actions that are not possible by any
pre-built commands or socials. It is not to be abused. It is only to be used
to add life to roleplay, not to force your own ideas on someone else's
character. To do so will be considered bad roleplay and breaking said rule.

   You can put in special colored speech in emotes with &1 and &2. For example
you get the output in an emote of '@CBlah Blah@w'@n if you enter &1Blah Blah&2 in an
emote. You can place # in the emote where ever you want your name to
appear(what appears depends on the viewer). Lastly you can place a * followed
immediately by a name to have another character's name placed (view dependent
also) into the emote. The name must be imeadiatly after the asterisk and its
first letter must be capitalized. (Example: *Carl). You can only target one
other character in an emote at a time.

ESCAPE
----------

   Escape is a skill that is used to determine a character's chances of getting
past a block. The block in this context is when another character attempts to
prevent the escaping character from leaving the room they are in.

Escape is also used to get out of the grasp of anyone absorbing/ingesting/grappling
you.

EVAL
----------

Usage: eval <variable> <expression>

* in %result%:
eval result %self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp% 
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
* this result will not change after the evaluation even if %self.hitp% changes.

   The eval command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to 
the result of the immediate evaluation of the provided expression. There also 
exists a "set" command, with the same syntax. Set differs in that the expression
is not evaluated until the variable is accessed.

EVOLUTION
----------

   Evolution is a racial ability possessed by Arlians. Arlian exoskeletons and
adrenal glands are capable of evolving continuously throughout their lifespan.
As an arlian takes more damage they begin to develope a better exoskeleton
beneath their current one. Once the damage received passes a certain threshold
they shed the old exoskeleton and reveal the new stronger version. This
increases their powerlevel and armor indexes permanantly. At the same time
their adrenal glands adapt to function with their improved exoskeleton. This
increases their stamina permanantly.

   Evolution is a passive ability. An arlian just needs to take damage from a
lethal NPC (not spar damage) over a period of time. You can check your
evolution level and evolution experience in the score menu.

   Your evolution level can not exceed double your character level. Otherwise
you will not advance evolution levels until that changes.

  * When damaging a NPC, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a NPC of higher powerlevel than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points.  If killing a NPC of lower powerlevel you'll gain
    less experience points

FACTION FACTIONS

   In DBAT, factions are similar to clans barring a few exceptions. Factions
are groups that were represented in actual DBZ lore. They are more permanent
than clans (meaning they won't die off, ever) and have a few perks for those who
join them over regular clans. However, membership is much more exclusive and
will be based on immortal approval.'

FEED
----------

   Feed allows one person grouped with another to feed that person a senzu. 
The person they feed a senzu to must not be fighting, they must be grouped with
the one doing the feeding as well. This is mainly for IC teamwork if a
teammate doesn't have a senzu, has no arms, or is unconcious. Any other use of
this should be handled as ICly as possible.

FIGHTING
----------

 Fighting is unique in Dragonball Advent Truth, as you must manually preform
each attack you wish to do.  There isn't a generic attack command(except for
with the use of weapons).  As you acquire combat skills you will acquire various
attacks.  Learning the basic skill punch for instance will allow you to use the
punch command against a target.  Your various combat skills, along with other
factors, will affect how well you do with different attacks.  We will not go
into detail as to what effects what because that is something for you to figure
out just as in real life.

   Fighting on DBT uses a unique cooldown system for attacks as well. The
length of cooldown is dependent upon the speed index of the attacker as well as
the base cooldown of the attack.

FINAL-FLASH FLASH
----------

   Final Flash is a technique invented and made famous by Vegeta. The user
pulls their arms back to either side and pools charged ki on their palms. They
then bring both arms forward slamming the wrists together with either hand
facing out palms flat. This attack comes out as a massive wave of energy rather
than a concentrated beam. On critical hits it does triple damage instead of
double.

Fireshield
----------

   Fireshield is a technique developed by demons long ago to protect their
bodies from enemies while also dealing out horrible pain in retaliation. 
Fireshield has a chance (based on the skill of the user) to prevent ALL damage
of a particular attack. If it does so there is a good chance the fireshield's
energy will be completely used up. Whether the fireshield blocks damage or not
though it will hurt anything that physically touches it. Punch, kick, knee,
elbow, uppercut, roundhouse, heeldrop, and slam will all cause 2% of the
target's maximum ki in damage to the attacker. Rogafufuken doubles this to 4%.
Any weapon that hits a fireshielded target will take damage (if it isn't
unbreakable) while leaving the attacker undamaged.

Fireshield and barrier can not be stacked together.

FIRST-AID AID
----------

   First aid is the skill to apply immediate healthcare to an individual. 
The most basic form of this is bandaging wounds which is where this skill comes
into play. You will need some bandages to attempt it though. It won't do any
good to bandage wounds that have already been treated recently either. Having
bandaged wounds helps broken limbs to recover faster than normal. 

Syntax: aid (target)
#0
FIX
----------

   Fix is a skill used to repair objects that have been damaged. Objects get
damaged in combat, or by being hit by attacks directly. Usually it takes a
while for them to break. You will want to fix things when you can as it will be
cheaper in the long run than buying the same equipment again and again. You
will need a repair kit to fix anything though.

FORGERY

   Forgery is a skill used to forge items. This isn't where you smith an item
out of ore, sorry. This is for the theives, frauds, and general low down crooks
seeking to rip people off. This is making a fake duplicate of an object you
already possess. It won't work like the original(or at all) but it will look
exactly like it in every way. Only your creativity holds the limit to what can
be done with this skill. The appraise skill is what is needed to determine for
sure if something is fake. Or trying to use the item if it has a function.

FORGET
----------

   @nThe forget command allows you to forget a skill you know, to free up a skill
slot. To forget a skill, go to your sensei and type @Cforget <skill name>@n to
begin the process. Only skills whose level is less than 31 can be forgotten.
Once you've used the forget command at your sensei, the skill you chose will
show up in your status and how close it is to being forgotten. To complete the
forget process, you need to practice (not autotrain) 5 skill levels for one or
more skills. You can only forget one skill at a time and tagging another skill
to forget will cancel your current one.

GENKI-DAMA
----------

   Genki Dama, also known as Spirit Bomb, is a technique invented by King Kai.
The user takes their charged ki and forms a large ball of energy from it. This
is only the base of the attack though as the main strength of the attack comes
from borrowing energy from others. If you have people grouped with you, you
will get 10% of their ki added to the strength of the attack. Due to its
immense size Genki Damas take a while to hit. This gives your target time to
avoid it if possible. Not only that but they have a chance to overpower the
attack if they are strong enough. However whether it hits them or not(unless
they over power it) it will have a chance to hit others in the room when it
explodes anyway. This attack will not hurt the user or any of their groupmates.

GENOCIDE
----------

   Genocide is an attack invented and made famous by Majin Buu. The true form
of the attack is a massive ball of energy. Due to its size it takes a while to
hit a target, but not as long as a Genki Dama. Since it relies on the user's
charged ki and can't draw out the power of anyone else it gets the advantage of
being boosted by the current strength of the user. A victim of this attack has
a chance to overpower it if they can. If they don't manage to overpower it, or
it hits when the victim is no longer around it will have a chance to damage
everyone else in the room(except the user and his groupmates)

GRAPPLE GRAPPLING

   Grapple is a skill to grab, hold, or choke an opponent. Depending on the
user's speed vs the target's, the current pl vs current pl, and skill vs bad
luck you may succeed to grapple or not. Those who are being grappled or are 
grappling will have the ability to perform other actions hampered or removed
completely while the grapple is in place.

   Those grappling and being grappled have their speed index reduced to their
speed stat while it is in effect. This matters mostly for those attacking from
outside the grapple. 

Grapple Types/Effects
---------------------
Hold: The victim of this and the user can not move or attack while the grapple
is in effect.

Choke: The victim loses stamina steadily until they pass out (KO). The victim
is capable of using its full arsenal of attacks while being choked. The user
is unable to attack at all while performing the choke.

Grab: The victim and user are both able to attack each other freely. The victim
and user can't leave while the grapple is in effect. The user gets a damage
bonus.

GROUP
----------

Those in a group get a bonus to exp earned from defeating an enemy. The
bonus is +10% for every member of the group. It maxes at 50%.

Usage: group [player]
       group all

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

  Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

  Quifael : "follow dragon"
  Redferne: "follow dragon"
  (Dragon should be following no one but himself)
  Dragon  : "group dragon"
  Dragon  : "group redferne"
  Dragon  : "group quifael"

HEALING-TANK HTANK
----------

   Healing tanks are devices that specialize in repairing the injuries on their
occupants. They are large enough to hold just about any size of humanoid, fully
submersing them in its special healing liquids. Healing tanks greatly increase
the speed of regeneration, allowing evenly the most heavily damaged warriors to
recover in short periods of time. There is a downside however, Healing tanks
run on energy, which depletes as an injured occupant is healed. If there is no
energy in the healing tank you will be unable to use it until it has recharged
for at least one regeneration cycle. It can hold a maximum of 20 regeneration
cycles at a time.

   Healing tanks can only be found on private ships, and only then if they were
purchased by the ship owner. Healing tanks are a must have for those enduring
intense training.

individuals, the Supreme Kai at the top of the order as well as four guardians,
of which King Kai is one (North Kai). The supreme kai rank is and always will

HEDIT
----------

 Hedit is the command used to write help files.  It is restricted to level 3

a NEW help file, you should write the help entry FIRST.  Format it to your
liking, and then after saving the entry enter the keywords via the menu.  The
keywords will then be automaticly added to the helpfile entry's top.  Be careful
with the keywords section of the menu as it WILL edit the top two lines of the
help file but it WON'T delete previous keywords on the file.  It will just push
them down and make them part of the entry.  This will make your help file
unpleasant to the eyes.  You should test hedit out on a file you will not be
saving first to see how it works before editing ANY existing files or writing
ANY new files.

   Hell Spiral is an android technique taught by Android 18. This technique
has the user hold their hand out in front of them with the palm facing upward.
They then pool their charged ki into their palm and form a large red orb. 
Once the orb is complete they quickly withdraw their hand and punch the orb
into a target. This technique strikes with an increased force due to the
violence of its launch and the density of the ki used to form it. It has an
incredible chance to break or destroy limbs it hits. As a final benefit to the
technique it gets a boost to its damage based on how advanced the android that
uses it is.

HONOO
-----

   Honoo is a technique invented by the King of Demons, Dabura. The user takes
their charged ki and mixes it with the air in their lungs. The ki changes the
air, using the hydrogen atoms and oxygen to create fire with a temperature
greater than 1000 degrees celcius. The user's ki protects their insides from
the heat of the flame until it has been spewed out of the mouth. The range of
this attack is actually pretty good. There is a good chance that a target
engulfed in its flames will be burned badly which will hamper their ability to
heal until the burns have been healed first.

HOSHIJIN2
----------

The Hoshijin are one of the eldest races in the known galaxy and perhaps the
first to take to the stars, whose original home world was located near the
galactic center. Those that are willing to 'sing' the story of their origins
tell of how they left their home world because it was dying. Their home world
suffered an environmental catastrophe due to a mixture of overpopulation and
centuries of using industry that generated mass amounts of pollution. Those
that were able to, fled via space craft though many couldn't and the majority
of the Hoshijin population are presumed to have died off.

The remnants of the Hoshijin people traveled through out the galaxy looking for
new places to settle. It is through this travel and inability to find anywhere
to settle and call their new home world, that their current name is derived
from. During this time the Eldritch star, which is central to the Hoshijin
religion, was discovered. Sitting in a system which had no habitable worlds,
the Eldritch Star gave off rays of energy that seemed to subtlety alter the
abilities of the Hoshijin depending on where they were. If it was in alignment
with a planet, that ability would be strengthened.

Many of the Hoshijin hoping to gain vastly superior power journeyed to the
Eldritch Star itself. Those that did, died excruciating deaths, as it seemed
exposure so close to the star overwhelmed them. Those who had not made the
journey began to chart the travels of the Eldritch Star, making notes on which
worlds it aligned with and when. Over the years, this led the star to becoming
a central icon in the Hoshijin religion. Those who were extremely fervent
would follow it's course and gain the most benefits. Others made the travels
less often, instead choosing to settle on a world for a time and assist there
before moving on.

The Hoshijin population in modern times is quite small and groups of them
larger than 20 are practically unheard of. They are secretive in nature,
hiding their true origins and religion from other races. Due to their
abilities, they are also able to conceal their true forms and very rarely
voluntarily reveal them.

General Description
In their true form, Hoshijin appear humanoid, their average height being
slightly taller than that of Humans. Their is skin translucent in well-lit
areas which gives them a wraith or ghost-like appearance. The features and
form of a Hoshijin are both slender and lithe, giving a natural eloquence to
their appearance. The males of the species all appear bald, unable to grow
head hair. Something that doesn't affect the female gender. A common cultural
practice amongst the Hoshijin is to tattoo their bodies with glyphs from their
ancient language.

HOUSE
----------

   Houses are nice places to rest your head, keep extra items safe in its main
room, and basicly have your own personal space. Aquiring a house costs money
though, and the time of an immortal. Ask an immortal for a house pamphlet and
then decide on what you want your house to have. Then that immortal and you
will build the house(after you pay the required price). Once you have paid for
a house you don't have to pay for it again. However if you delete that
character your house will be removed by an imm without notice. Don't waste our
time on houses you won't feel like keeping.

HSEDIT
----------

   House Edit is used to build houses, clan vaults, or ship storage bays. 
Houses are to be owned by the player who purchases them. Clan vaults must be
flagged as a clan room and owned by Clanman(an unused player file). Ships
storage bays must be an unowned room and "owned" by Shipman(who is like
clanman). All "house" rooms must have an atrium which needs to be an exit
connected to the room you used house edit in. The rest of house edit is self
explanitory I would hope. If you need any help further just ask Iovan.

HYOGA-KABE KABE
----------

   Hyoga Kabe (Glacial Wall) is a Hydromancy technique that forms a wall of
water from the user's ki. That wall of water then freezes solid. The wall
while it lasts completely blocks off a direction to the room the user used it
in. For example if the technique is used to block off the north exit of a room
then the wall is formed in the room the north direction connects to and forms a
wall blocking the south exit of that room (which leads to the north exit of the
Room the technique was used in). These walls will melt of their own accord
(slowly) over time. They can also be attacked and destroyed. Their durability
depends on the intelligence, wisdom, ki, and skill of the user. However a user
of the skill can just disolve a wall by using the skill on it again.

IF ELSEIF END

Usage: if (expression)

 elseif (expression)
...
 else
...
 end
   if (if %actor.vnum% == -1) 
     %echo% You are a player
   else 
     %echo% You are a mob.
   end

   An 'if' must occur before the other three. If expression evaluates to true 
(@RHELP EXPRESSIONS@n), the statements between the if statement and the next 
elseif, else, or end are executed. If it stopped at an elseif or else, it scans 
for the next end, and continues execution at that point. If the expression 
evaluated to false, it searches for the next elseif, else, or end. If it finds 
an elseif, it checks that expression. If it is true, it executes the statements 
between the elseif and the next elseif, else, or end, and then finds the end of
the block. If it is false, it continues searching in the same pattern, until a 
true elseif is found, an else is found, or an end is found. There may be 0 or 
1 else statements and 0 or many elseif statements in the block.

For anyone having trouble with the format of if/elseif/else/end blocks
@RTSTAT 22@n. Relsqui made this excellent example.

KAIOKEN
----------

   Kaioken is a skill invented by King Kai of the North Galaxy. It is a
technique where the user compresses their ki into their body increasing their
strength and speed. It has different levels, determined by how much ki is
compressed this way. Depending on the level and the strength of the user the
Kaioken technique can hurt the body.


   There are 20 levels of Kaioken in all. It is best to start at the lower ones
and work your way up so your body doesn't give out with the technique failing.
How successfully you can first achieve a kaioken level depends on your skill and
the level of kaioken being attempted. How long you can hold a kaioken level
depends on your overall skill or if you have taken a sufficient amount of damage
while in a kaioken state.

   Kaioken not only raises your current powerlevel for a period of time, but it
also increases the amount of damage you can do when performing attacks. Not
only that but it raises your speed index as well.

KIATTACKS
----------

   Ki attacks are ranked by a tier system. Different attacks have different
effects, bonuses, strength level, and so on. This determines what tier they are
ranked in. While attacks within the same tier may differ from each other there
is sometimes something they all share.

   The tier ranking system will be explained a little bit below. While to find
out the bonuses/effects a particular skill may have individually you should look
at that particular skill's help file. This will just cover what skills in a
tier share with each other.

Tier 1
------
   Skills in this range are the most basic of the basic. When striking a limb
they have the least chance of destroying that limb. They have the weakest
maximum power but have the lowest cooldown time after use.
Tier 2
------
   Skills in this range are more specialised and generally carry a higher
maximum power than anything tier 1 has to offer. They have 10% higher chance of
destroying a limb if they hit it than Tier 1 skills.
Tier 3
------
   Skills in this range either have a very special use, or have a higher maximum
power rating than Tier 2 attacks. They have AT LEAST 20% higher chance of
destroying a limb if they hit it than Tier 1 skills.
Tier 4
------
   Skills in this range have a higher maximum power rating than Tier 3
attacks(Sometimes greatly higher), and special effects. They have AT LEAST 30%
higher chance of destroying a limb if they hit it than Tier 1 skills.
Tier 5
------
   Skills in this range are the best of the best. They have no limit to the ki
that can be put into them and either have a special affect or additional ways to
charge the skill. These attacks take a while to prepare leaving the user
defensless in the meantime.

a small chance upon creation of a saiyan character to be born a Legendary Super
Saiyan. If your saiyan is lucky enough they will be gifted with two
transformations instead of the usual four. However their transformations will
not drain stamina and they have a bit of a difference between them and other
saiyan transformations.

   The first transformation they get is Super Saiyan First. They happen to get
this transformation a lot sooner though while still getting the same amount of
boost from it as a normal saiyan. Their second transformation is the Legendary
Super Saiyan form. This form is on par strength wise as Super Saiyan Fourth
but earned far sooner and with no stamina drain.

LEVELS
----------

Usage: levels

   This command lists the levels you can gain throughout your playtime on the

Sessions with each level. Some levels give higher than average boosts as a
bonus, those levels will be detailed below.

   Level 100 gains no exp. However instead you have a good chance to gain
1/4th the EXP to PL/KI/ or ST

   At level 15 and above it costs RPP to gain a level. The amount of RPP that
is required is listed in score underneath the experience listing. On levels
that significant soft-cap ranges are found (such as 31, 41, etc. ) there is no
RPP cost to level. Finally on even levels the cost is reduced by 1.

    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

MAJIN
----------

 Majins are a magical race who's origin is surrounded in mystery.  While the
great wizard Bibidi claims to have created Majin Buu this can not be certain.  
The existence of other majins puts doubt on this pointing towards the wizard
merely creating the being known as Majin Buu.  Majins are generally pink colored
humanoids with a single forelock of varying length protruding from their
foreheads.  They are usually quite powerful.

MAJINIZE
----------

   Majinize is an inate ability that majins possess. Although there is a
limited number of majinizations that a majin can perform during their lifetime,
they can revoke a previous majinization if they wish and give it to another. A
majinized victim gains a 40% of their base added to max. This majinized victim
can not attack the one who majinized them(their master) unless they are released
from their majinization. To majinize someone they must be close to your
alignment as well as following the user.

   @RThose who have a majinize removed from them are free to attack the majin who
majinized them. However they lose a significant portion of their strength that
may be greater than what they originally received depending on how large they
have grown. @n

* We have one mob giving a quest. This mob sets the targets id as a global on 
* the player via the 'remote' command, like this:
eval quest_object %obj.id%
remote quest_object %actor.id%
* We then have another mob receiving the quest object, with the following script.
if !(%actor.varexists(quest_object)%)
  return 0
  halt
end
* now we know the player has a quest_object variable
makeuid obj %actor.quest_object%
say Have you brought me %obj.shortdesc%, %actor.name% ?
say You must bring it to me to complete your quest, you know.

   Creates a new variable with the name given, whose contents shall be suitable

MASENKO
----------

   Masenko is an attack invented by Piccolo, though it was most famously used by
his student Gohan. When using Masenko the practitioner places both hands on top
of each other and raises them up above and slightly behind their head with their
palms facing outward. They then bring both hand forward aimed at their target
and fire a large beam. The masenko beam's damage is mainly found in the large
ball of energy at the front of the attack. This attack is equivilant to
Kamehameha in damage, but also has the occasional affect of draining some of the
victim's stamina.

MOON OOZARU
----------

   Oozaru or the Great Ape form as it is also known is a genetic trait that
those with saiyan blood possess. When witnessing the full image of a celestial
body they absorb blutz waves and transform into a large ape. This only happens
if they still have their saiyan tail. When the body in question goes away so
does the blutz waves and they revert to normal. If their tail is removed they
also return to normal.

The following planets have moons which enable Oozaru
----------------------------------------------------------
Earth
Vegeta

   Full moons happen to appear on the nights of the 20th-22nd of every month. 
Why all moons of these planets do it at those times and never in a progressing

OASIS
----------

OasisOLC is the name given to a set of on line editing tools that can be
used by authorized players to examine, change and create the various world
entities that make up the Mud environment.  It is referred to as "on line"
creation because it allows people to create and edit things while the mud
is running, or on line.  This is opposed to the traditional method of editing
the various text files that comprise the mud "world" using various off-line
editors (typically vi or emacs), and the restarting the mud so that the
updated files are reloaded.

Categories of Oasis Commands
----------------------------

1)  Commands to examine the existing mud operation.  These are the [x]list
    commands, that can be used to view a range of world objects, and give
    a summary of their descriptions.  The actual commands are:
    mlist - List Mobiles               slist - List Shops
    olist - List Objects               zlist - List Zones
    rlist - List Rooms

2)  Commands to change or create entities and mud operation values.  The
    commands are:
    aedit - Actions (socials) editor   redit - Room editor
    cedit - Configuration editor       sedit - Shop editor
    medit - Mobile editor              tedit - Text file editor
    oedit - Object editor              zedit - Zone editor

3)  Miscellaneous commands.
    buildwalk - Create rooms by walking around
    dig       - Open exits between two rooms
    rclone    - Create a copy of a room
    saveall   - Writes al outstanding changes to disk

Using the Editing Commands
--------------------------

All of the edit commands are menu driven.  See OASIS-EDIT for general
instructions on how the menu interface works.

Granting Access to Oasis Commands
---------------------------------

Access to the Oasis commands are controlled through a number of means.  Of
course, the master command list (in interpreter.c) specifies the minimum
level for a player to call the command.  This is typically set to either
LVL_BUILDER, or LVL_GOD.  A few commands are restricted to the implementor.

A player can always edit a zone and its contents if their name is in the 
zone builders list (see ZEDIT for more information).  Finally, a player 
may be granted OLC rights to a specific zone by means of the "set" command,
using "set <player> olc <zone>".

The implementor has unfettered access to all Oasis commands.

External Documentation
----------------------

Refer to "The CircleMUD Builder's Manual" that is shipped with the CircleMUD
distribution, as this provides considerable invaluable information that is 
essential to anyone building on a mud, whether off-line or using Oasis.  The
main reference documentation for OasisOLC can be found at:

     http://dgscripts.n3.net/

OASIS-EDIT
----------

The OasisOLC edit programs make use of a menu interface, and each of the
various commands has a similar appearance.  Each attribute of the thing
you are editing is listed, with a menu number against it.  These numbers
start from the number 1, run through the digits to 9, then use the letters
A onwards.  You enter the number (or letter) corresponding to the item you
wish to change.

Some menu items will lead to sub-menus, for example setting various bit
fields.

In general, the letter "Q" will quit (with the option to save) the menu
level you are currently at, although some sub-menus use the number "0"
to leave the menu.

Types of Menu Items
-------------------

1)  Single value items.  These correspond to attributes that have a single
    value or a simple list.  For example, a room name, an object's weight,
    or the list of aliases for a mobile.  Enter the value(s) and press the
    return key.

2)  Long text fields.  This corresponds to a multi-line text string, such
    as a room's description.  This makes use of the "enhanced edit" text
    editor.  Use the "/h" command in the editor to see the various options.

3)  Multi-value fields.  This is a menu item where you have to enter several
    values, such as an object's value flags, where there can be up to four
    values that you have to enter.  Each value will have its own prompt, so
    enter the value as directed by the prompt, and press the return key.

4)  Bit string fields.  This menu item goes to a sub-menu, with all of the 
    possible bit values listed.  You can select as many values as you wish, 
    with each menu number on this sub-menu toggling its corresponding flag
    on and off.  Use the menu item "0" once you have set all the flags you
    require to return to the top menu.

5)  Multiple choice fields.  This is where the attribute has one of a number
    of possible values, such as an object's type or a room's sector type.
    The sub-menu will list all the possible values, so to choose the value
    you want, enter the menu item number that corresponds to the particular
    choice you want.  This is unlike the bit string field, in that once you 
    make a choice, that value is recorded and you are returned to the upper
    menu.

6)  Sub menus.  Selecting this menu option takes you to a sub-menu where a 
    new set of menu items are listed.  Once you have finished working at 
    this sub-menu level, generally 0 or Q will return you to the upper menu.

Saving Your Changes
-------------------

If you have changed the thing you are working on in any way, taking the 
"Q" option from the top-most menu will save the object, if you respond
with a "Y" at the save object prompt.

PERSONAE-AND-RELATIONS
----------

@RNote: In regards to personality, this is only a general guideline. We are not
forcing you to roleplay what is outlined here. @n

   @CSaiyans@n are a proud warrior race with an intense love of battle. Generally
speaking they look down on other races and this is especially more evident the
higher up a saiyan is born into their caste system. Elites and Royalty tend to
be extremely arrogant and demeaning towards other species and even those of
lesser classes amongst their own kind. Saiyans have no particularly like or
dislike of any race but tend to view half-breeds (half saiyan, half human) in a
rather distasteful manner. Showing ones strength through battle could win the
friendship of an individual saiyan.

Dislikes; Half-breed - mockery of saiyans/not pure blooded.

   @CHumans@n are relatively new to the space faring game in comparison to alot of
the other established races and although society has come to accept "aliens"
amongst them, there is still strong factions of xenophobia that could stem from
the fact the Human species in the past were racist in a similar way that Saiyans
are with their class system. Next to Mutants, Humans are undeniably the most
varied species in the known galaxy, with so many different personality
archetypes and appearances there cannot be any true generalisation of them
beyond they tend to be cunning and have shown time and again they able to
overcome every obstacle thrown at them.

   -Cold War w/ Icers: There is a desire in the government of Earth to become
the big boy of the galaxy, the leading light for all overs to follow. To this
end, they have begun stockpiling arms and preparing to go to war with the Icers
(lead by the WTO). The Icers are known as slavers among many other things which
Human Governments are strongly against.

   Demeaning and arrogant, @CIcers@n don't just think they are better than you, they
know it. The harshness of their home planet has impacted profoundly on their
personalities and culture, forging them into a harsh and ruthless species. 
Outwardly they appear to have no care in other species but Mutants seem to hold
a soft spot for them as their "favored slaves". Their slaving operations and
aggressive world conquering has left relationships with just about every other
race particularly sour.

   -Cold War w/ Humans- Earth is an untapped resource as far as the WTO is
concerned. That and they of the belief that the Humans may develop to a point
of being able to challenge their power. No official attacks have been made but
Earth has the WTO's attention.

   -War w/ Namek: A small invasion of Planet Namek has begun. Reasons behind it
are unknown but only a fraction of the WTO's forces have been committed
believing Namek an easy target.

PERSONAE2
----------

@RNote: In regards to personality, this is only a general guideline. We are not
forcing you to roleplay what is outlined here. @n

   @CNamekians@n are generally a peaceful race composing of sages and farmers. 
Although possessing strong and well trained warriors, they do not actively
pursue conflict. Despite the agrarian culture of the Nameks, they have actually
had space faring vessels for a long period of time. They tend not to leave the
planet however unless there is a reason to do so. Icers have invaded planet
Namek and initiated war with the Namekians for control of the planet. Because
of this, Namekians have come to dislike Icers and the World Trade Organisation.

   More of an umbrella of races, rather than an individual one, @CMutants@n are the
most varying in terms of appearance and personality in the galaxy. However many
mutants have been integrated into Icerian culture either as slaves or other ways
and taken upon similar fierce personas. Some mutants believe that working for
the Icers is the best way to further their own species, while others detest the
widespread slavery of Mutants.

   @CTruffles@n are the most advanced technological species in the galaxy. Due to
events that have caused them to lose their home world, Truffles have a burning
desire for revenge and utter contempt for the Saiyans, of whom conquered their
world. Most Truffles are happy to lead people on in the belief they fled their
home planet and are the last of their kind, until they can trust their
companions enough. A trust which isn't earned easily. Peaceful by nature, they
secretly perform small scale military actions throughout the galaxy, presumably
to either recover old Truffle Technology or prevent it by whatever means falling
into hands that would misuse it (Like the Hyper-gates).

   While not at a point where they can hope to retake their home world from the
Saiyans, the Truffle people work toward the day they can oust the "monkeys" and
walk upon Planet Plant once more.

   As a result of their hatred of Saiyans, they also have a dislike of
Half-breeds who appear very much the same as their pure blood relatives.

PERSONAE3
----------

@RNote: In regards to personality, this is only a general guideline. We are not
forcing you to roleplay what is outlined here. @n

   As a mixture between Saiyans and Humans, @Chalf-breeds@n tend to fall somewhere
between the two personality wise. How much a half-breed leans towards a
particular sphere is usually dependant on which species genes are dominant. A
common trait amongst their kin is an almost overbearing need to earn their
parents approval.

   Half-breeds have no official stance on other species and will usually adopt a
similar stance to either both or one of their parents.

   Although mostly evil, a benevolent @CDemon@n is not unheard of. However most
have an angle that aims to improve their lot in life even if they are doing a
good deed for someone else. Power is the strongest currency amongst Demons,
especially those who reside in Hellfire City. Demons can take on the embodiment
of a sin and this will often shape their personality greatly as a result.

   Demons have an incensed hatred of the heavenly Kaios. Although not all
Demons come from being exiled Makaio, this is where the hatred first originated.


   @CKais@n have ascended to the top of the universal hierarchy, essentially running
it on behalf of the mysterious immortals and this instils a sense of pride and
honour amongst their kind. Most Kaios who earn roles in this heirachy are often
extremely pious individuals who are content to sit back and watch the universe,
carefully intervening where necessary, often indirectly. Most Kaios will never
get the opportunity to take on a role like this however so great honour is
usually bestowed upon those who are appointed assistants to the Grand Kaios and
so forth. Although mostly good by nature, occasionally a kaio is born of evil.
These are branded as Makaio and if they cannot escape authorities, will be
exiled into hell.

   Due to the relationship between the kaios, their fallen brethen and demons,
Kaios have a dislike for Demons and actively seek to keep their influence
minimal on the universe.

PERSONAE4
----------

@RNote: In regards to personality, this is only a general guideline. We are not
forcing you to roleplay what is outlined here. @n

   @CAndroids@n can have any number of personality traits which is largely dependant
on the race of the creater and the android's intent. Other factors may affect
this but generally speaking there is no way to broadly define android
personality types or specific enemies or friends.

   @CBio-androids@n are similar to Androids in that it is impossible to broadly
define their personality types. They make take on an assumed personality
programmed into them by their creator but occasionally a portion of the DNA that
makes them up can become dominant even if not intended. Creators intent and the
DNA soup that make up a Bio-Android will ultimately define it's personality.

   @CKonatsus@n are a people drenched in a history of tradition. Their traditions
and ways have barely changed in over a thousand years and the same goes for
their technology. Although each village has their own culture and traditions,
generally speaking, konatsus are polite, proud and very honourable. If a
Konatsu pledges himself unto you, he will continue to honour that pledge until
the task is completed, often even if it may end up with his death in the
process. Although there have been female warriors amongst the Konatsu, many
villages still place heavy restrictions on their females and it can be quite a
sexist environment. Worship of a divine being known as Temujin is the pillar of
the only religion present on Konack and a majority of the population are of this
faith.

   The only known enemy of the Konatsu people are Truffles for their involvement
in the civil war that threatened to destroy Konack centuries ago.

PERSONAE5
----------

@RNote: In regards to personality, this is only a general guideline. We are not
forcing you to roleplay what is outlined here. @n

   @CKanassans@n can come in one of two varietys; A larger and more reptilian in
appearance sub-genus which is often more aggressive and fierce compared to the
more common, fish like sub-genus which tend to take on more mundane roles in
society and are more docile, friendly and intelligent compared to their larger
counter-parts. Kanassa is a world that has seen much fighting and has fueled a
largely military based society. Numerous attempts at colonising other worlds
have been met with failure on most fronts due to the powerful presence of the
Icer led World Trade Organisation.

   Views other species with suspicion. However may consider aligning itself
with another species should they have similar goals to take down the Icers, of
which they currently lack the military strength to do so alone.

   The only common personality trait amongst most @CMajins@n is immaturity and child
like behaviour. They will often be instilled with behaviour by the sorcerer
that creates them. Although very rare, it is rumoured majins may be able to
undergo a process where a small portion of the original Majin becomes detached
and unable to return to it's form which will then take on basic instincts of
it's own, before finding a host to ingest of which the personality of the
original majin and the host are combined. By nature, any creature ingested by a
majin will affect both their personality and their appearance.

PHASE
----------

   The Eldritch Star is a mysterious astral body that is only understood by the
Hoshijin and only partially understood by even them. They are naturally atuned
to the Star's strength on a universal scale. The Eldritch Star goes through
phases of strength each month. Each phase affects the Hoshijin differently and
they are the only ones who are affected by these phases. The three phases will
be listed and described below.

   Birth Phase (1st-15th of every month): This phase increases; powerlevel, ki,
stamina, strength, and speed. It also vastly increases the rate at which hoshijin
regenerate while standing.

   Life Phase (16th-22nd of every month): This phase increases; powerlevel, ki,
stamina, strength, and speed a great deal more. It also vastly increases the
rate at which hoshijin regenerate while standing.

   Death Phase (23rd Onward): This phase gives Hoshijin no boosts. This is
their most vunerable phase.

PLANETS
----------

 Planets are large celestial bodies that orbit stars.  In this particular case
they are important centers of interest to the game.  There are multiple planets,
including planets that are off the transportation grid and reachable only
through private ship.  A list of planets can be found below along with whether
the planet is important or backwater.  There are asteroids, spacestations, and
other astral bodies that can be visited but they will not be listed here.

   Space in DBAT covers only a section of the North Galaxy. Let's face it,
galaxies are huge in real life. You wouldn't expect us to do all of North
Galaxy let alone South, East, and West along with it. Would you?

PLANT
----------

   Plant is a command used to put things objects into someone else's inventory.
Why would you do this? Well who knows, perhaps you stole something of theirs
and then made a forgery to replace it with. It will take them longer to know
what is up if they have a fake sitting benignly in their inventory. Also if you
wished to frame someone for whatever reason you could plant a controversial
thing on them. Be creative!

PLAYERS LOGON
----------

   The logon count is important for not only showing the number of people
logged on but also for determining rewards to be handed out. If someone logs
on and puts the logon count within 4 places of the highest logon record then 1
RPP will be handed out to everyone on (and each user account that logs on in
the next 24 hours). If the logon count matches the highest record then 2 RPP
is handed out. If it beats the record then 3 RPP is handed out. Each of these
rewards can only be obtained once per user account and the same reward will not
be passed out more than once per 24 hour period.

   This is to encourage activity of current players and recruitment of new
players. So try to bring some friends in to share in the fun.

POCKET-DIMENSION DIMENSION
----------

   Pocket Dimension. Creating a pocket dimension is a tricky task. There is a
rumor though that rare prisms made by myterious means hold the power to create
one for temporary use. The advantages of a pocket dimension are up to you to
find out.

   Using a prism once will create the dimension and send you to it. Using it
twice will return you to the room you originally left. It is not advisable for
you to leave your belongings in a pocket dimension. They may be lost forever
as a result.

POTENTIAL-RELEASE PR
----------

   Within most warriors is a hidden potential of strength that they are unaware
of and unable to grasp consciously. Those who are trained in potential release
can bring that out of a target. A target's potential can only be released once
period. The amount of their potential that gets released depends on the skill
of the one releasing the potential. Up to a maximum of 50% of the target's base
powerlevel. So if you are seeking to release, or have your potential released,
then find someone who has a high skill for best results.

PSYCHIC-BARRAGE BARRAGE
----------

   Psychic barrage is a technique where the user focuses their charged ki into
their brain. They close their eyes to visualize the attack and then open them
again while looking upon their target. They then fire ki charged psychic blasts
at the target. This attack has the chance to damage the target's mind making it
impossible for them to focus on charging ki until they recover.

PSYCHIC-BLAST
----------

   Psychic Blast is a technique where the user takes their charged ki and
activates the dormant parts of their brain. They then fire that charged ki
along with negative thoughts at a target. No matter where the blast hits on the
target the thoughts will possess their brain during the moment of the attack,
showing them their worst fears in that instant. Its maximum power rating isn't
very high, but it has a high chance of forcing a target to lose some of their
charged ki from concentration loss.

mobiles and objects, but will not harm players.  If the argument is an object,
that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed.  If the
argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory and
equipment lying on the ground.

If the argument is the name of a player, the player's inventory and equipment
will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her connection.  For this
reason, PURGE should only be used on players in disciplinary situations.

Examples:

  > purge
  > purge Pom
  > purge sword

RADAR DRAGONRADAR SPACERADAR
----------

 There are two types of radar.  Dragon radar used to find the locations of
dragonballs(if they are not currently stone and thus unable to be found) and
space radar used by private ships to detect the closest direction to a
particular planet(which helps in navigating the vastness of space).

   How to go about obtaining a dragon radar, is a secret.  If you know the
dragonball universe well you should know where to go looking for one.  Ship
radar however is available with the purchase of a private ship.  

Dragon Radar

2%   = 11 minutes
5%   =  4 minutes
10%  =  2 minutes
20%  =  1 minute

of the ki you use to regenerate. This will help you spend less ki in the long
run. For Majins and Bios regenerate has the chance to save them from death if
they are cut in half or lose their head. That is if they have the ki. All
regenerate races have the ability to regenerate their limbs normally though.

Usage: reload < '*' | all | file >

Reload is used to reload text files such as the MOTD from disk into memory.
reload * reloads all the text files below.

Valid files are:

REMOTE
----------

Usage: remote <variable> <id>

Remoting a variable saves that variable to the player file for future access. 
This is used heavily for quests to limit a player to only performing it once.
Here is a quick example from zone 14. The variable must first be set and then
saved to the players file via remote, like:
  * setting the variable to 1 means completed.
  set solved_example_quest_zone_14 1
  remote solved_example_quest_zone_14 %actor.id%
Then in future triggers it is checked if that variable already exists in the
player file. In this example, if it does the player is not allowed to continue.
<variable> should always be a unique name. I suggest always including zone #.
<id> can be any value or text you wish to use later.

   Create a global variable belonging to a character or player whose id is 
specified. The variable must first exist in the script that is running.

For more examples go through the trigedit hallway.

REWARD REWARDS RPP
----------

   Rewards are special 'rewards', go figure, that you can puchase with Roleplay
Points. Roleplay Points are earned mainly through roleplay logs that you post
on the MUD forum and that have been graded by a roleplay authorized
immortal(RAI). RAIs determines based on a set of criteria how much RPP a player
can be awarded per log. This can be found in the rules section of the Roleplay
Board located on the forum.

   @CIf you are spotted RPing your character well you can receive as much as 2 RPP
from a RAI. The definition of well being; 1: Follows the rules and 2: Shows
effort. You never know when you may be watched by an RAI. @n

To spend your RPP use the rpp command.

   The request rewards will not be handled instantly. You will need to wait on
an imm to deal with them.

   The instant rewards will be handled... Instantly. The revival reward and
the experience rewards have their costs calculated automatically based on your
current level.

RIP
----------

   Rip is a command that allows you to try and rip the tail off of a victim. 
If the victim is awake slower than you and weak enough you will be able to pull
their tail off. If the target is the user of rip or asleep then the command
will succeed no matter what.

   Tails grow back randomly over time so this is not a permanant solution to a
"tail" problem.

Syntax: rip (target)

ROGAFUFUKEN
----------

   Rogafufuken, or Wolf Fang Fist, is a technique where the user takes their
charged ki and infuses their hands and feet with it. This both increases their
speed temporarily as well as strengthens the blows of their hand-strikes. This
technique was invented and made famous by Yamcha. Most of the damage of this
attack is done by the ki that was charged, but the user's strength increases the
attack power considerably. 1 STR equals +1% damage. So a strength of 15 would
be +15% damage.

ROLEPLAY-LOG
----------

   Roleplay logs may be posted on the forum or given to other players. You may
only do this after the log in question is over 1 week old and things involving
the log are not going to effect things currently being roleplayed. Anything in
a log CAN NOT be used as IC info for anyone playing. If you are caught magicly
knowing things you shouldn't you are breaking IC and will be punished. 

   This is how you should make the log. Copy everything that happened
surrounding the log. Cut out prompt info(such as current pl) and anything that
would not be visible to either player at the same time. Basicly emotes, says,
combat messages, action messages, movement messages are ok. Score, status,
prompt, ooc channels, auction, etc. Are not ok. You must edit your own logs.
Logs that show great roleplaying will be rewarded by those involved in the
log(not just the one who made the log) receiving a higher roleplay ratings(seen
in whois and score). Those with higher roleplay ratings will be able to request
restricted races and be involved in immortal roleplay quests.

about that question will help you go a long way.

SAVE
----------

Usage: save

Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

Note that the SAVE command only saves your equipment in the event of a
crash.  If you are leaving the game normally, SAVE will NOT save your
equipment -- you must find an Inn to store your belongings.

better if you start your sentences with either say, tell, whisper or shout.

Examples:

  > say Hey, does anyone know how to get to Oz?
  > tell catje hi, how are you?

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in:

  > ' hello there.

Shout broadcasts your message to everyone is your geographic zone.  Holler
broadcasts to everyone in the game but costs 20 movement points.  You must
be level 2 before you can use shout and yell.

They can do this specificly which will yield more information, or they can do
this unspecificly where they scan an entire planet or area.

Syntax: scouter scan (this will scan an entire planet for available powerlevels)

   Scouters of lower quality explode when they directly scan a powerlevel too
high for them to read. Below scouter classes and the maximum powerlevel they
can read before exploding will be listed. 

Basic Scouter: 149,999

SEISHOU-ENKO
----------

   Seishou Enko is a natural attack that Arlians possess. They are capable of
using it from the time they are small children. This attack is utilized by
charging their ki and firing a beam of energy from their fleshy mouths. They
have an instinctual control over the technique which allows them to control the
ki used for it to a high degree. Whenever Seishou Enko misses a target in any
way the amount of charged ki used is divided by 4. This allows the Arlian to
preserve their charged ki for more Seishou Enko uses.

SELFDESTRUCT SELF-DESTRUCTION
----------

   Self Destruction is a technique where the user focuses their charged ki,
available base powerlevel (converted to energy by this technique), and base
stamina (converted in much the same way). The user will flash as the technique
is prepared. When it is ready the user needs only use the command again and
they will explode. This will either focus all the damage on one victim if they
are grappling with them or on everyone else in the room. If it is not
concentrated on one target it will only do half damage.

   You gain skill in self destruction everytime you manage to pull it off. 
The gain is large and random. Due to the nature of the skill it isn't
something you will likely "train" often. Also the length of time to prepare a
self-destruction will vary depending on your skill with it.

   @RSelfdestruct can be cancelled by retyping selfdestruct but only during the
prepration phase. @n

SENSEI TRAINER TEACHER
----------

 Sensei are teachers.  More specificly they are the main trainer that your
character learns from.  There are trainers who anyone can learn from, and
trainers who are extended branches of a Sensei's school.  However Sensei are
only the trainer that was chosen during character creation.  Depending on your
sensei you may have trainers available to your character others may not have, or
lack trainers others have.  This adds complexity and strategy to what sensei you
choose.  Not all sensei paths are equal, but all have their upsides and
downsides.

SET
----------

Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

If on the other hand you do have a ship you are going to 
want to know the commands associated with it before you get
going. Here are those commands...

look out window : Use this command when you are in the same
room as the cockpit window. This allows you to see outside
the ship.

leave : This allows you to leave out through the ship hatch.

enter (ship name) : This allows you to board the vessel.

pilot ready/unready : This either has you take command of the
pilot's chair or release command of it.

pilot (dir) : This will allow you to direct the movements of
the ship as you see fit.

pilot launch : This will launch the ship your are piloting from a
spaceport.

SHOPS
----------

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact.  Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise.  Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!

To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

SKILLS
----------

 Skills is a command that lists the skills you know. These have their own level
and depending on that level will rate their chances of success and how strong
their effects are. Skills can be trained through use once they have been learned,
or through practicing them at an official trainer. As PS is hard to come by it is
more efficient to train through use than to spend PS. PS should be saved as much 
as possible for learning new skills.

   You can limit what the command skills shows you by using it with an argument.
Such as a number to limit skills to showing you the skills you have that have a
level of that number or greater, or a string of letters to show skills that have
those letters in their name.

SMOTE
----------

   Smote is a type of emote that is more free-form, allowing the user to write
more complex messages of their character's actions. Smote requires you to
include # in place of your name somewhere in it. Otherwise an OOC tag with
your username will be placed above the smote for OTHERS to see. Smote should
not be abused, it is not for writing actions that are impossible or for
deceiving other players into thinking it is a game message. Abuse of smote
will be punished under the breaking of character rule. 

   You can put in special colored speech in emotes with &1 and &2. For example
you get the output in an smote of '@CBlah Blah@w'@n if you enter &1Blah Blah&2 in an
smote. You can place a * followed immediately by a name to have another
character's name placed (view dependent also) into the emote. The name must be

the nature of gains on levels. The exact formula for when a softcap occurs is
not going to be shared here.

Spiral Comet
----------

   Spiral Comet is a technique perfected by Jeice and Burter. It is usually a
two person attack that uses great speed to rain ki blasts down on a target. 
Ginyu has taken the skill and altered it slightly for his students to use it as
a solo skill though. The user begins moving incredibly fast in a spot above
their target creating a vortex. They launch a large first strike blast once
the vortex is formed which will consume up to 50% of their total ki. They will
continue firing attacks afterward. These attacks will worth 5% of the user's
ki. Since this attack is sustained for such a long duration the user is
capable of putting 100% charged ki into it.

   While the technique is in use the user is unable to be hit by physical
attack or ki attacks that are below Tier 4. The only exception is if the ki
attack is also an Area of Effect attack.

STATE-OF-THE-UNIVERSE
----------

   A fragile peace reigns supreme over the known galaxy, only briefly broken as
the World Trade Organisation seeks to expand it's holdings. But make no
mistake, this peace, so fragile that it is, will be broken.

   Even now, the machinations of war are afoot. Plans are being drawn up,
weapons stockpiled and soldiers train rigorously. When the fragile peace
shatters, it shall shatter with the sound of a thousand symphonies. When the
fragile peace breaks, the flames of war shall scorch every corner of the galaxy
before they are extinguished.

   The saiyans, barbaric and warlike as they are, will wash out into the galaxy,
seeking worthy fights to prove their strength, uncaring of the consequences.

   The gaze of the World Trade Organisation has fallen on Earth, knowing that
the planet home to the Humans has become a glittering jewel in the galaxy.

   But the humans are not without their own ambitions, many believe themselves
capable of imposing an order and peace on the universe that will herald a new
age.

   The hidden remnants of the Truffles plan their revenge on the Saiyans, who
conquered their home world planet Plant. When the time is right, every saiyan
will pay their debt to the Truffles with their blood.

   The Kanassans, a mixture of reptilian and fish-like humanoids, have had
numerous clashes with other galactic powers before. Most recently, the World
Trade organisation. Kanassa, their home world, has been scarred to the point
where it can barely support their current population, so the Kanassans have been
seeking to colonize other worlds for some time, with mixed success.

   Even the serene world Aether, home to the Kaios is not saved from conflict.
The birthrate of the Makai has increased greatly in recent times, this swelling
of numbers has made it nigh impossible for them to be exiled. The exact state
of this conflict is unbeknownst, even to the citizens of Haven but the Makai
have taken over half of the Kaiju forest, where they are their brethren are born
from the Kaiju fruit. The stark reality is that the Kai may soon be overwhelmed
by their dark brethen.

off their feet if it hits the body or gut. It has an even better chance to
knock them down if it hits their head.

TAISHA-REIKI
----------

   Taisha Reiki is a technique that places an aura of regeneration around a
room. It only lasts while the ki that was consumed lasts. Sometimes it
disappears on its own. While the aura of regeneration is in effect anyone in
the room will regenerate their stamina in a single hour. This technique is
taught by someone on Namek.

TAPION
----------

 Tapion is a knight of Konack.  He has a younger brother named Minosha, who
along with Tapion fought against the mythical beast Hirudegarn.  Tapion has
taken it upon himself to teach others how to fight in order to prevent the
destruction his world faced ages past.  His style focuses more on technique and
less on strength.

Difficulty for Newbies: Medium Hard

New Tapion characters start with a Throwing Knife and have a chance to start
with up to two additional Throwing Knives.

TELEPATHY
----------

   Telepathy is a skill that allows one to send their thoughts to someone else
or read the thoughts of a target(In the form of useful information about that
character). Those who use this skill are trained in focusing ki into their mind
to activate dormant parts there.

   If you link your mind with someone else not only will you not have to target
them when using message telepathy, the target will be able to think to send
their thoughts to you. 

   Farsight is an ability telepaths have to see through the eyes of a target
(if possible). The target may become aware of this advanced intrusion if they
are intelligent enough and they may reject it entirely if they are a telepath
of greater ability. 

Syntax: telepathy (read) (target)
        telepathy (target) (message)

TEXT-EDITOR TEXTEDITOR /d /i /h /s /a /c /ra /l /fi WORDWRAP WORD-WRAP FORMATTING /e#
----------

   The text editor is what you use to write room/mob/obj/extra descriptions,
mudmails, and even boards. It allows you more commands than the typical entry.
To learn the commands while using the text editor, type /h. It will tell you
what all the / commands do. Always use /fi to format, indent, and word wrap.
It looks much better to see writing that is formatted than one that runs all
over the place wrapping around etc. Just simply type /fi on a new line and hit
enter. Before you save type /l to list the buffer and see for yourself how it
looks. Fix as needed.
   When entering the text editor for the first time make sure to use /c to clear
the current contents. Indent and format all descriptions by typing /fi (format
with indent) in the text editor.  This includes all forms of OLC, mudmails,
boards, and anywhere else you use the text editor. This will indent the line
by 3 spaces and wrap your text at less than 80 characters so telnet users can
read it.
 
Editor command formats: /<letter>
 
@n/a         -  aborts editor
@n/c         -  clears buffer
@n/d#        -  deletes a line #
@n/e# <text> -  changes the line at # with <text>
@n/f         -  formats text. 
@n/fi        -  indented formatting of text (highly recommended for all desc's)
/fi#       -  indented formatting on a specific line
/fi #-#    -  indented formatting on specific lines
@n/h         -  list text editor commands
@n/i# <text> -  inserts <text> before line #
@n/l         -  lists buffer
@n/n         -  lists buffer with line numbers
@n/r 'a' 'b' -  replace 1st occurance of text <a> in buffer with text
@n/ra 'a' 'b'-  replace all occurances of text <a> within buffer with text
        usage: /ra 'pattern' 'replacement'
@n/s         -  saves text

NOTE: /f and /fi in trigedit will autoindent your trigger.
Commands such as /r, /n, /e#, /i#, /d# are invaluable and will make your job
much easier. For example lets say you mistype "the" with "teh" in a 10 line
description. Instead of /c (clearing) the text you can /r 'teh' 'the' or if it
was on line 5 you can type /e5 <line with teh spelled correctly> or /d5. Learn
all these options.

Usage: time

Gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening Hours of the shops, for example.

Usage: tlist <range of vnums or zone number>

Tlist gives you a list of the triggers numbered within the parameters.
Be warned that all the triggers on TBA may not work since anyone could
have made them. Ask around for the best examples. Zone 13, 40, 41 is a 
good start.

   tlist 13          - lists all triggers defined in zone 13

TRAINING
----------

   Train is a command that has several branches to it. This command allows you
to train one of the six cardinal statistics to your character. Those being
strength, constitution, intelligence, speed, agility, and wisdom. The gravity
of the room you are in as well as the amount of weight you are wearing (not
carrying, but wearing) determines how quickly you can increase one of those
stats. Each stat has a limit it much reach before it increases. That limit is
5,000 + 500 for every point of the stat. When the limit is reached the number
is reset for you to try and increase the stat again (with any change from your
last train carried over with the reset). 

   Special Weighted equipment can be found on Earth. This will greatly
increase the benefits of training along with any other heavy equipment/weapons
you may happen to find.

   You must be wearing a sufficient amount of weight to train at all. The
amount is 100 x your level. 

   Those who have a level above 80 get a large bonus to each train they
perform. Those who have a level above 60 get a small bonus to each train they
perform.

TRAITS
----------

   Traits are physical or mental attributes to your character. They can be
positive (Bonuses) or negative (Negatives) and all of them have a different
affect. You choose these during the creation of your character and they can
not be altered after that point.

You can check your traits with the status command.

TRANSFORM TRANSFORMATIONS
----------

@n   Transforming is a trait every race in DBAT shares. Their transformations are
all unique however. They all differ on strength, and what is required to earn
the transformation. Some also differ on whether they use up stamina while
transformed and how fast stamina is used up by each individual transformation
they happen to have. For example Super Saiyan Third uses up more stamina than
Super Saiyan Fourth. Super Saiyan Fourth uses up more stamina than Super Saiyan
Second. It depends on the power of the transformation and the race that has it.

   Some races do not have very good transformations compared to others. 
Transformations are not the only qualifier for strength when it comes to a race.
Transformations have been balanced on DBAT so don't expect the status quo of
transformations in DBZ. That wouldn't make for very fun gameplay.

TRIBEAM
----------

   Tribeam is a technique that was most famously used by Tien. The user forms a
triangle with their hands and aims at a target with the gap between the hands.
A sudden blast of powerful charged ki is fired from the gap between the hands
and slams into the opponent. This attack is has the advantage of hitting the
target with a small cooldown period after it hits.

TRIG-ATTACH
----------

Usage: attach vnum id
* This small trigger will attach a trigger to the carrier this can for instance 
* be used if you want the mob to change attitude by adding another trigger 
* (ie - mob was mad - mob got apple - mob gets a 'nicer' trigger attached
attach 3001 %self.id% 

   This command allows a script to attach a trigger (referenced by vnum) to 
anything capable of receiving triggers, by id number. (%self.id%, %object.id%, 
and %actor.id% are examples of id numbers, for use with this command.)

See Also: ATTACH, DETACH, TRIG-DETACH
#1
TRIG-DETACH
----------

Usage: detach <vnum | all> id
* if we - as described in the attach example, want our mob/obj/room to behave
* differently, it's not always enough to just add another trigger with attach.
* it might be necessary to remove some old ones :
detach 3000 %self.id%
or
detach all %self.id%

   The opposite of attach, this removes triggers from the specified target.

Example: @RTSTAT 45@n

See Also: ATTACH, DETACH, TRIG-ATTACH
#1
TRIG-RETURN
----------
 
Usage: return 0
 
   Return sets the return value of the trigger. Normally, a script will return
1, unless return 0 is specified. Unlike most computer languages, the return  
command does not end the trigger's execution. The value is returned after all 
the commands have been executed, or a wait or halt command is called. 

Example: @RTSTAT 1364@n

See Also: HALT, WAIT
#1
TRIG-SET
----------

Usage: set <variable> <value>

Set sets variable to value, without evaluating it. 
 Example: set foobar 15 - 5
 sets the variable foobar to the string "15 - 5"

* this example sets the value of result to '%self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp%'
set result %self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp% 
* The %result% var now works as a 'function' every time it's accessed.
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
%damage% %self% 30
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%

   The set command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to 
the provided expression, which will be evaluated when the variable is accessed. 
There also exists an "eval" command, with the same syntax. Eval differs in that 
the expression is evaluated immediately.

See Also: EVAL
#1
TRIG-SWITCH TRIGEDIT-SWITCH CASE DEFAULT BREAK
----------

Usage: switch expression
    
switch %random.4%
  case 1
    emote sings a merry song about someone named Fulbert and Beatrice.
  break
  case 2
    emote booms out loudly, 'Heigh Ho! Heigh Ho! It's home from work we go!'
  break
  case 3
    emote tries to sing falsetto, but his voice doesn't agree.
  break
  default
    sing
  break
done

   Switch evaluates an expression and looks for a match amongst the case 
statements that follow. If none of the following case statements are a match, 
and a default statement exists, the default statement is considered a match. 
If a match is found, the commands that follow it, up until a break or done 
command, are executed. 
Break is used to terminate commands in a switch. 
Case is used to begin a new conditional group in a switch block.
Default is similiar to case but matches any condition not met. 
Done is used to terminate a while or switch block.

TRIGEDIT-ADVANCED
----------

@RWARNING: long and verbose (wordy)@n

To add life to the worlds circlemud uses something called scripts (or triggers). 
There are three major types of game objects which can use scripts. These are 
mobiles (mobs), objects, and rooms (world objects). Examples of scripts in the 
game are: 

Cityguards screaming 'PROTECT THE INNOCENT! BANZAI! CHARGE!', (a mob script).
A portal that teleports players when they enter it (an object script).
A room that creates a new exit when a player pulls a lever (a room script).

Each game item (room, mobile, or object) can have a script. A script is composed
of one or more triggers, which work in collaboration to define complex actions 
of the game object. A trigger is a definition of an event that the script watches 
for, and list of commands to execute when that event occurs. 

There are several different types of triggers. Each trigger type determines
when the trigger will be checked. For example, a mob speech trigger is checked
every time a character who is in the same room as the mob with the trigger uses
the 'say' command. A room enter trigger is checked every time a character
enters the room. There are two parts of the trigger used to determine if the
trigger's commands are executed when it is checked, the argument and numerical
argument (NArg). Some triggers use both; some may use only one of the two; and
some may use neither. The interpretation of these two fields is dependant on
the type, and is described in more detail on the webpage and in the help files.

When an event in the game occurs, each script in the room where the event 
occurred is checked to see if there are any triggers which are supposed to
react to that event. A trigger currently running (such as from a 'wait'
command) is skipped. Only one trigger of each script will be run by a single
event. For example, if there are two triggers on a script, and both are the
same type with the same arguments, the second trigger will only be run if the
first one is already running. 

Triggers can be of more than one type. For example, to simulate a cursed item,
a trigger on the object could be of types drop, give, and remove. A more common
combined trigger would have both random and global types, so the random trigger
would be checked even when the zone was empty. Combined triggers must have the
same argument and numerical argument. 

The other component of a trigger is the command list. This is a series of
commands that are executed when the trigger is run. Commands are chosen from
two groups of commands, script specific commands and game commands. Script
specific commands are those commands that only the script interpreter can
recognize. These include flow control commands (such as if, elseif, else, end,
halt, wait, and return), and commands to manipulate variables (such as set,
eval, unset, and global). Game commands are those commands that a player could
issue from their command line as well as special commands added for mobiles,
objects, and rooms.

TRIGEDIT-ADVANCED-TUTORIAL
----------

This section is a step by step tutorial to explain the writing of scripts 
(triggers). It goes through the script creation process developing a practical
script. 

Decide what you want the script to do. 
   Consider how your mob, item, or room should behave. Doing this before
worrying what can be done prevents you from limiting yourself to what you have
seen other scripts do, and allows you to produce a more interesting script. 
  
For example, I want to create a gate guard for a small walled town. The ruler
of the town has decided that each group of people will be charged ten coins to
enter his domain. The gate guard must notify travelers of the cost to enter,
collect the money, allow people who have payed to enter the city, and close the
gate after them. This will be a mob script. 
  
Decide what trigger types you need.
   Look through the section on triggers to see the currently available trigger
types. New trigger types can be added by one of the implementors if needed. All
types are listed in the help files @RHELP TRIGEDIT-TYPE@n.
  
Our gate guard needs to react to five different events: 

1. A character entering the room from the south, the road leading away from the
   town, needs to be informed of the price for entrance. This will be a greet
   trigger. 
2. When the guard is given ten or more coins, the guard must open the gate. This
   is done by a bribe trigger. 
3. If the guard is given less than ten coins, the guard needs to inform the
   character that it is insufficient. This is also a bribe trigger. 
4. When someone passes through the gate into the city, the guard must close the
   gate behind them. This is done with an act trigger. 
5. When the gate is opened from the other side, the guard must eventually close
   it. This will be another act trigger. 

Determine the argument and the numerical argument of the triggers. Read the 
specifications on trigger types, and decide what the values for argument and 
Numeric Arg must be for the trigger to react appropriately to the events.
  
@RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-GREET@n
Argument    : not used 
Numeric Arg : the percent chance that the trigger is run when checked. Since I 
              want it run every time someone enters the room, it should be 100. 

@RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-BRIBE@n
Argument    : not used
Numeric Arg . minimum number of gold pieces required to activate this trigger.
              The guard should only open the gate when given 10 coins, so it
              should be 10. 

For the second bribe trigger, the guard must respond whenever someone gives 
him 1 or more coins, so Numeric Arg should be 1. 

@RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-ACT@n
Argument    : the text the mob should react to. Since I want the guard to 
              react to a character going north, argument should be "leaves 
              north." 
Numeric Arg : Since argument is a phrase, NArg should be 0. 

The second act trigger should trigger on text "The gate is opened from the other
side", so it is triggered whenever someone opens the gate from inside the town.
Again, Numeric Arg should be 0 for a phrase. 
  
Write the list of commands for the trigger.
This is the most complex and time consuming part of a trigger to write. The
valid commands are explained in the help files and on the webpage. Variables 
and expressions are also used in the commands list.

For the greet trigger, I want the guard to inform anyone entering from the
south how to get into the city. First, I must check if the character is
entering from the south. If they are entering from that direction, the guard
should tell the character the cost of entry. The command list for this trigger
will be as follows: 
  
if (%direction% == south) 
 wait 1 sec
 emote snaps to attention as you approach. 
 wait 1 sec
 say Admittance to the city is 10 coins. 
end 
 
Checking the specifications of the greet trigger, we see that the variable
"direction" is set to the direction that the character entered. The percent
sign surrounding direction means it is a variable. The two equal signs together
compare the value of the variable to the word "south". If these are equal, the
statements between this line and the line "end" will be executed. The "wait 1 sec"
pauses briefly while the character finishes his move. (The greet trigger is
actually checked before the character enters the room, so if we did not have
this line, he or she would never see the guard snap to attention.) After
another brief pause, the guard announces the cost to enter the town. The
indentations are not needed, but make it easier to read. 

The guard must open the gate if ten or more coins were given to him. The
command list looks like this: 
  
wait 1 sec
unlock gate 
open gate 
wait 10 sec 
close gate 
lock gate 
  
After a brief wait (so everything doesn't happen at once), the guard unlocks
the gate and opens it. The guard will close the gate after 10 seconds, even if
no one passes through it. 

The guard must inform the character that his payment was not enough, and
return the money. The commands list will be: 
  
wait 1 sec
say This is not enough! 
give %amount% coins %actor.name% 
  
For the line "give %amount% coins %actor.name%", the variables amount and actor,
both set when the bribe trigger is called, are substituted into the line before
the guard performs the command. The gate guard returns the number of coins he
was given. 

For the first act trigger, I want the guard to close and lock the gate after
someone passes through the gate. The guard should wait briefly so he isn't
shutting the gate on the character's back, and close and lock the gate. The
command list will be: 

wait 1 sec
close gate 
lock gate 
  
For the last act trigger we want the guard to close and lock the gate when it 
is opened from the other side. The commands will look like: 
  
wait 5 sec 
close gate 
lock gate 
  
The "wait 5 sec" gives time for someone on the other side to get through the gate. 
Decide the order of the triggers. The triggers are checked from first to last.
If there are two triggers of the same type, the first one run will be the only
one run. 

There are two sets of triggers which are the same type, the bribe triggers and
the act triggers. If the bribe trigger with the Numeric Arg of 1 is first, the 
other trigger would never be run, since ten or more coins is still one or more. 
In order for my triggers to work right, the trigger with Numeric Arg of 10 must 
be before the trigger with the NArg of 1 in the list. The other possible 
conflict is with the act triggers. Since both have arguments that will not 
occur together, the order does not matter. 

Create the trigger file.
Simply use trigedit to create your triggers and they will be saved for you
when you exit the editor. 

Put the triggers into the game.
In the OasisOLC medit / redit / oedit menus, use menu option S to enter the
script editor. Then select the triggers that will be part of your script. Note,
that order is important! If there are two possible triggers that could both be
executed at the same time, only the first one found in the list will be
activated. In this example, it means place the bribe trigger for 10 or more
coins BEFORE the bribe trigger for 1 coin. 

Test the script.
You should see how the script actually works in the game, and watch other
people interact with it. Often you will see ways you can improve it.

Mob trigger tutorial
This mini-quest is setup in TBA as an example. @RGOTO 1310@n and work your way north
with nohassle off.
 
The following 7 steps should give you a general idea about what to do, and how to go 
about making small quests in the dg scripting language. This example is concentrated 
on quests involving mobs. 

The process can be broken down to the following:  
   1. Decide what you want the script to do.
   2. Make corresponding objects and mobs.
   3. Split up the quest.
   4. Find corresponding trigger types.
   5. write the scripts for the triggers.
   6. Attach the scripts - permanently
   7. Done ? 
   
1. Decide what you want the script to do.  
   In this example, we want to make a small mini quest in an area. The quest 
will work like this: When you enter the room, where the first mob is, it will 
start to tell a tale. In this tale, you are instructed to perform a task, in 
this case, kill an evil ogre, that lives in a nearby forest. As proof of the 
kill, you must bring back the ogre's apprehension to the questgiving mob. 

2. Make corresponding objects and mobs.  
   Ingredients for this quest:
      1 Questgiver mob - I've chosen 'the questmaster' - vnum 1310
      1 Target mob - In this case 'an apprehensive Ogre' - vnum 1311
      1 Quest object - 'some apprehension' - trash object, vnum 1300 

3. Split up the quest.  
   Next thing to do is look at the different steps involved with the quest. In 
this example, we have three steps: 
   Player entering room -> tell story 
   Player finds ogre -> load object (Do not just want the mob to carry it) 
   Player gives questmaster apprehension -> reward player 

4. Find corresponding trigger types.  
   Having split the quest up also means we reasonably easy can decide what 
kinds of triggers we need - in this case: 
   mob GREET trigger (attached to questmaster) 
   mob DEATH trigger (attached to ogre) 
   mob RECEIVE trigger (attached to questmaster) 
 
5. write the scripts for the triggers.  
    Up to this point, neither trigedit or the script editors have been used. 
All the info needed is in the help files and on the webpages. Notice most of
the work required is PLANNING! You must know exactly what you want to do before
you do it. Now is the time to fire up trigedit and start editing the triggers. 
Let's give the first one vnum 0, and edit it to look like the script below: 


> trigedit 0
Trigger Editor [0]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example 1310 - Quest Offer@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yGreet @n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@c* we don't want him to tell this to mobs. vnum -1 is reserved for players.
if %actor.vnum% == -1
  * only greet players coming from the south.
  if %direction% == south
    *wait 1 second, always give the player time before you start sending text.
    wait 1 sec
    say Can you help me, %actor.name%?
    wait 1 sec
    say An apprehensive ogre has something of mine.
    wait 1 sec
    say If you slay him I'll give you all the coins I can spare.
    wait 1 sec
    say Please, bring me the apprehension he has stolen.
  end
end@n

The script above will be executed every time anyone enters the room. If the 
person entering is a mobile, the if check at the beginning will stop the 
execution. Note, that I've named the trigger as I did above. ALWAYS include
the VNUM of where you plan on attaching the trigger. Also, give it a name so 
it is easy to see what part of the quest this trigger handles. The second 
script is very simple.

> trigedit 1
Trigger Editor [1]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example 1311 - Kill ogre@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yDeath@n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@csay you got the best of me %actor.name%.
* load some apprehension
%load% obj 1300
* reload the mob for the next questor
%load% mob 1311@n

The above script will be executed when the mob is killed - just before the 
death cry. The last script just needs to check if the object handed over is 
the correct one. Let's see it, here with vnum 2: 

> trigedit 2
Trigger Editor [2]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example 1310 - Give/Quest Completion@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yReceive@n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@c* check if this was indeed the right object
if %object.vnum% == 1300
  wait 1 sec
  say Thank you, %actor.name%
  %send% %actor% %self.name% gives you a gold piece.
  %echoaround% %actor% %actor.name% is rewarded for his valor.
  nop %actor.gold(1)%
  wait 5 sec
  %purge% obj 1300
else
  * this wasn't the right object - don't accept it
  say I don't want that - bring me back my apprehension.
  return 0
end@n

The script above is pretty self explanatory, but to clarify a bit: First check 
if the object is the correct vnum, then give the reward, and send messages to 
the player and others in the room. If it wasn't the object, reject it, and use 
the return value of the script to prevent the object being passed over. Lastly, 
and very importantly, 'end' ends the if. 

6. Attach the scripts - permanently  
   Proceed and add the scripts to the two mobiles through medit: 

> medit 1310
[medit menu]
Enter choice ? S
     Script Editor

     Trigger List:
     <none>

 N)  New trigger for this script
 D)  Delete a trigger in this script
 X)  Exit Script Editor

     Enter choice :
Here, add the scripts by typing N, then the script vnum: 
Enter choice : n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 0
Enter choice ? n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 2
Enter choice ? x

And add the trigger vnum 3 to the ogre in a similar manner. 

7. Done ?  
   The scripts are now attached to the correct mobs, and the players of your 
mud can now take the quest whenever they wish. This is a great time for 
considering improvements to the little quest: 

Balance issues: 
   Should players get a smaller reward if they perform the quest many times ? 
   Should it be limited to 1 quest per player or 1 per reboot ? 
Gameplay issues: 
   Perhaps other mobs in town should tell the player to go see the old man ? 
   Should the ogre always load the object, or only when people know he has it ? 
   Are there other mobs who would like to pay for that object ? 

The above list is just a few examples. All of them could be implemented, but 
it is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

TRIGEDIT-NAMES TRIG-NAMES
----------

1) Name         : @ynew trigger@n

Always use names that explain the trigger. More importantly: always include the
VNUM for the mob/obj/room the trigger is going to be attached to.

   It's important to give your trigger a name you and others can understand. 
Even more important is including the VNUM of what it is attached to. This way
tlist and stat will show the name description and VNUM allowing others to 
quickly comprehend what the trigger does. A good name could be 'guard shout for
help - 101' or 'mage cast poison - 300' even 'cursed object - 130.'

Examples:
   Quest Offer - 1310       --> trigger attached to mob 1310
   Fall Down Stairs - 1300  --> trigger attached to room 1300
   No Dropping Stuff - 1301 --> trigger attached to obj 1301

----------

3) Trigger types: @yGreet@n
This is a bitvector  of which kind of events this trigger is triggered by. This 
is the most important part of the trigger. It's here you decide if you want the 
trigger to react on people dying in the room, dropping objects, saying stuff, 
entering, jumping insanely up and down or whatever else you might think of.

This part is also the most important, in the sense that the rest of the triggers' 
info means different things, depending on what trigger type the trigger has.

TRIGEDIT-VARIABLES VARIABLES TRIG-VARS TRIG-VARIABLES VARS 
----------

Variables appear as a name surrounded by '%'s, such as %actor% 

Before a command is processed, the line is scanned and any variables are
replaced. First the list of local variables are checked to see if the variable
is there. If not, the global variables are checked. A proper global match must
have a zero context or the current context of the script. (When a script starts
running, its context is 0. The script context command may be used to change
context.) If a match is still not found, a list of 'built in' variables (ones
not declared by the script) are checked. If no match is found, the variable is
replaced with an empty string (the variable is removed from the line, and
nothing added in its place).

There are two types of variables, local and global. All local variables are
deleted when a trigger finishes executing, and can only be used by the trigger.
Global variables remain until removed with unset, or the script is removed. 

Global variables also have a context associated with them. By default, the
context is 0. Any global being referenced with a context of zero will be seen.
Through the 'context <value>' command, a script may set its context to any
integer; Globals created are always assigned the current script context. When a
global is referenced, if it's context is not 0 or the current context of the
script, it will not be seen. This technique allows, among other things, arrays
of globals to be created by using a series of contexts as indexes. Also, it
allows globals to be associated with a specific character, room, or object in
the game, by using the id of the target as the context. 

Variable Fields 

A field of a variable can also retrieved, based on their type. To get a field,
a notation of %variable.field% is used. The valid fields are listed in the help
files below. 

@RCHAR-VAR@n - Variables for characters.    @RTSTAT 27@n
@ROBJ-VAR@n  - Variables for objects.       @RTSTAT 28@n
@RROOM-VAR@n - Variables for rooms.         @RTSTAT 29@n
@RTEXT-VAR@n - Variables for text.          @RTSTAT 30@n
@RSPEC-VAR@n - Variables for special stuff. @RTSTAT 31@n

TRIGGER-EDITORS
----------

A trigger consists of the type, information on when to execute it, a list of
commands, and a list of variables. Each class of game object (mobiles, objects,
and rooms) have their own set of triggers. 
#1
TRIP
----------

   Trip is a skill that has the user try to trip or knock a target off their
feet. It's success depends on the skill of the user, and the speed index of
both the user and target. If the target is flying they can not be tripped.

Syntax: trip (target)

TRUFFLE TUFFLE
----------

 Truffles/Tuffles are a small race originally from the planet Plant
which later became known as planet Vegeta when the saiyans who were also on that
planet took it over.  Truffles are a small race of intelligent humanoids who are
generally not very strong but excel in technological pursuits.

Race Classification: Specialist/Ability
Best Trainer: Any

TSTAT TRIGEDIT-EXAMPLES EXAMPLES TRIG-EXAMPLES
----------

Usage: tstat <trigger vnum>

Tstat lets you learn more about a specific trigger. 
Be warned that all the triggers on TBA may not work since anyone could
have made them. Ask around for the best examples. Zone 0 are the basic
examples. For more examples check out zones 13, 19, 27, 29, 77, 236 and 
237. There are numerous others. Look around, just beware some may not be
"good" examples. 

To learn more about any of these just tlist <zone #> then tstat each
trigger individually. You can always ask Rumble to find you an example.

#1
TSUIHIDAN
----------

   Tsuihidan is a technique where the user fires a special kiball that homes in
on a particular target's ki signal. The user doesn't have to be able to sense
the target to use this technique and has no control over the attack after it is
released. This attack is good for targets that have a high chance of avoiding
standard attacks or who may try to escape, as the tsuihidan will follow them.

TSUNA
----------

   Tsuna is the premier Hydromancy Master of Aquis City on the planet Kanassa.
A former priestess for the local temple she has trained in Hydromancy all her
life and desired to pass it on to the common people who are usually unable to
obtain expensive lessons. The only other teachers readily available being at
the Temple which has strict membership obligations. As a result of this Tsuna
has a rocky relationship with the Temple's order.

Difficulty for Newbies: Easy

Found At: Aquis City on Kanassa

TUNNEL
----------

Usage: tunnel <direction> <room vnum>
       tunnel <direction> -1
This command will create a new exit from your current room to the target 
room, and if possible, create the reverse exit from the target room back
to the current room.
You can remove an existing exit by specifying a target room of "-1".

TWIN-SLASH
----------

   Twin Slash is a technique where the user channels their charged ki into a
sword. The user saves some of the charged ki for their own body, using it to
boost their speed to pull off the attack. Two slashes that happen so fast they
appear to almost be a single slash make this a very dangerous attack for a
target to withstand. While it doesn't have a high maximum power, it has a
greatly increased chance to sever a limb should it strike it than any other
attack in its class.

WARP-POOL POOL
----------

   Warp Pool is a Hydromancy technique where the user connects two bodies of
water on different planets at one point. This bridge lasts for only a few 
seconds and will only accept the user through it. The bodies of water must be
large. Such as an ocean or sea. Currently there are only five known worlds that
have large enough bodies of water. Earth, Frigid, Kanassa, Namek, and Aether.
This technique was devised as a means of quick travel for Kanassans to explore
other oceans on other planets without the need for a ship and with the safety
of stealthly arriving on another world. 

Syntax: warppool [ earth | frigid | kanassa | namek | aether ]

WATER-RAZOR RAZOR
----------

   Water Razor is a Hydromancy skill that originates on the planet Kanassa. 
The user of the technique focuses an invisible force of ki into a target's
body. With this ki they take control of the water in the target's body and
cause all that water to form millions of microscopic blades for an instant. 
This damages the insides of the target's body immensely. It will damage their
Powerlevel, ki, and stamina about equally and at the same time. It is
important to note that androids are immune to this technique as they do not
have enough water in them for it to work properly.

WATER-SPIKES SPIKES
----------

   Water spikes is a Hydromancy technique that involves the user forming a ball
of water out of their ki. They then raise this ball of water above their head
and form several spikes of water out of it. The spikes freeze and are launched
at a particular target. The strength and sharpness of the spikes is perfectly
formed by the technique allowing for incredibly strong and sharp projectiles.
It never has a weak hit even when hitting a limb and because of that has a
higher average of damage than other skills of it's tier.

ZEDIT
----------

Usage: zedit [<room number>]
       zedit new <zone> <bottom room> <top room>
       zedit save [<zone>]

The zedit command is used to create new zones, change the characteristics
of existing zones, and create and edit individual zone commands.

The first variant of the zedit command is used to change values for an 
existing zone and add or modify the zone commands that relate to a particular
room.  If no room number is given, zedit will work with the room the player is
currently in, or if a room number is specified, it will work with the zone
that contains that room.  The zedit menu is in two parts, the upper part 
being used to set the overall value for the total zone (zone name, reset
mode, and so on), while the lower part lists the zone commands that relate
to the particular room.

The second variant is used to create a brand new zone, specifying the zone
number and the range of room vnums that the zone contains.  This will bring
up the standard zone edit menu.

The third (and final) variant will save the complete zone to the disk file,
for either the zone specified or, if no zone number was entered, for the 
zone that the player is currently in.
