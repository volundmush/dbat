ADMINLEVEL IMMORTALS
----------

   Technically according to DBAT's heirarchy Implementors are the highest
ranking of officials working for the MUD. Along with admins a ranger of
rankings are listed in this file detaling exactly what immortals are and the
meanings of their particular rankings. 

   @GImmplementors@w - Usually restricted to owners of the MUD. Said owners do
not necessarily own all the assets of DBAT, but are in fact imbued with the
power to make major decisions toward the direction of the MUD in most every
area. In a dispute between owners Iovan has final say, and in particular final
say regarding what is done with his code. 

   @GAdministrators@w - These are the seconds in command to the Implementors, and
have final say over most general things unless overruled by an Implementor. 
This is the highest rank most immortals can usually achieve, as achieving
Implementor status requires a great deal of trust and a vacancy in the
Implementor ranks.

   @GVice Admins@w - These immortals can make general decisions within their
respective fields as long as they are not overruled by a higher ranked
immortal. Administrators and Implementors should issue directives to Vice
Admins delegating duties to them as necessary. Good Vice Admins will have a
keen grasp of current MUD sentiments among both the immortals and player base,
and should provide accurate updates to their superiors regarding anything of
note in regard to said sentiments.

   @GHigh Enforcers@w - These immortals have been given the responsibility of
making sure the rules are followed by players and immortals alike. In
particular High Enforcers are in charge of all lesser enforcers and have final
say in rules arbitration unless overruled by a superior. In the event of
immortal rule breaking High Enforcers should contact every superior with the
same report to prevent a coverup from occuring.

   @GFirst Class Enforcer@w - These immortals focus mostly on enforcing the rules
of the mud, and have had enough positive history as an immortal and experience
of at least four months. Generally speaking First Class Enforcers should take
care of most rules arbitrations and only seek a superior if required. Players
that experience a First Class Enforcer that is not applying the rules
appropriately may petition a superior ranked IMM.

   @GEnforcers@w - The catchall rank for the lowest immortals regardless of their
main job. All immortals are tasked with enforcing the rules if they are the
only ones available to do so, but in general this rank of immortals should
observe how their superiors perform the task prior to being assigned rules
enforcement as their priority role. Enforcers are to enforce the rules as
necessary regardless, but if a superior is present they should be notified with
the problem first, and if that superior wishes to delegate it to the enforcer
or there is an understanding prior to do so on a particular issue then that is
fine.

ADRENALINE
----------

   @nAdrenaline is possessed by most biological creatures known to civilization
(in varying amounts) but Arlians in particular possess the ability to control
their advanced adrenal glands. This allows them to convert stamina into
powerlevel or ki whenever t ey need to. The trade is an exact 1:1 ratio with
zero chance of failure. @n

@nExample:

AEDIT
----------

@nUsage: @GADEIT <social>.@n

   @nThis allows you to create new actions (socials) and edit values for existing
socials. Values that can be edited in this process are either those that
control the command operation (minimum character level and position, sort order
in the command table, etc), or the resulting messages that are sent to the
character issuing the command, others in the same room, and the command victim.

   These messages can use substitution parameters as per the act() function,
which is described in greater detail in the do umentation "The act() Function"
included as part of the stock CircleMUD release. @n

AFK
----------

   @nThe afk command is used to signal that you are not currently at your
computer, and are unable to respond at the time. It's nothing more than a flag
that shows you're away, so do not expect it to give any sort of protection. 
However, if someone is sporting the afk flag, you are not to do anything to the
character (stealing, attacking, etc). @RThis does not mean abuse the afk flag,
if you are very clearly present, and still using it, the flag will be ignored.

@n

You will not receive tells while using the afk flag.

There are two paths to revival in AL/Hell depending on your alignment. You
will have to wait at a variable amount of real life hours before you are

ALIAS ALIASES
@c------------------@n
@nUsage: @Galias [alias name] [command]@n

@nAn alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands. The ALIAS command is used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.@n

@n>alias

@nType ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases can not be nested or used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the ALIAS command itself, 


f course).

@n>alias gbb get bread bag
@n>alias gac get all corpse

@nType ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

@n>alias gbb

@nA semicolon ("
") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with a single alias.

@n> alias eat get bread bag
@n eat bread

   @nNote that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the
MUD's internal eat command aliases may not be nested or used recursively. The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with an
alias. @nExamples:


@n>alias killem cast 'fireball' $1
 cast 'harm' $2
@n>alias helpem cast 'heal' $1
 cast 'bless' $1
 cast 'armor' $1

@nThe special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:
@n>alias tr tell rasmussen $*
@n>tr hi there, how are you today?
@nYou tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

@RIf you save the MUD instance you are in when the alias is made, your character aliases will be saved.@n

ALIGNMENT: GOOD/ EVIL /NEUTRAL
@c-------------------------------@n
@CAlignments in Advent Truth@n

@YGood@n
   Someone who is good generally does good things. It's fairly simple. You
don't murder people for no reason. You generally don't steal from people for
no reason. You should generally attempt to right wrongs and help out if it is
within your means to do so. At the least, you will not enjoy it when bad
things happen to those that do not deserve it. 

@DNeutral@n
   Someone who is neutral believes that there is a balance that must be
maintained between good and evil in order for the universe to function. It is
not as simple as, @WOh hey, I'm neutral... I can do whatever I want! @n Being
neutral means that you honor the system of the universe and its balance over
the individuals in it, more or less. 

@REvil@n
   Being evil in general means that you do not respect life or the beliefs of
others. You kill, steal, or do other evil acts. This is not an excuse to PK
anyone at any time. NPCs can be killed without much care, but player
characters should be special deaths that mean something in a storyline, and as
such, should have a good role play leading up to it.

ANSI COLOR
@c----------@n
@nUsage: @Gcolor [off | brief | normal | complete]@n

@nIf you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see. 

@n  > color off
@n  This command disables all color.

@n  > color brief
@n  > color normal
@n  > color complete

@nThese three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see which level suits your personal taste.

@n'color' with no argument will display your current color level.

@nUsing color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly. The effect is more noticeable on slower connections. Even if you have color turned on, any non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all. 

@nThe colorcode entry will show you what codes can be used to make what colors.

APPENDAGES LIMBS
----------

   @nAppendages are the arms, legs, and in some cases tails of a race. Looking
at someone can show the status of their limbs. For yourself, it is best to
check status to view your appendages. Loss of appendages can happen if you are
not careful. This will a fect you differently depending on which limb or how
many limbs you have lost. Not having arms will surely make manipulating
objects and using hand attacks impossible. No legs will make getting around
difficult as well. Losing your head will, well you can guess what that will
do. @n

   When recovering from a broken limb from it healing over time, if you do not
have a bandage on you will suffer a 1 point loss to Strength, Agility, Speed,
and Constitution. Heal, regenerate, senzu beans, and bandages will prevent any
such stat loss.

   Limbs now have a visible condition. Now a limb below 50% of condition is
broken, and though it can still be used will damage the limb further if done
so. Limbs can still be outright destroyed (or severed) and limbs that are
damaged to 0% condition are also destroyed (this includes through forcing their
use when broken. ) Now limbs above 0% recover when sitting (1% per tick),
resting (3%), and sleeping (5%). On top of this bandages (which function
differently now) add a 10% recover every tick they are on (regardless of
whether you are standing, sitting, or whatever. )
 
Limb condition is viewable from the status screen (or by looking at someone)
 
Armor Index helps protect limbs from condition loss.
Armor Index Limb Protection Table
-----------------------
AI (50,000) reduce limb damage by 5 (to minimum of 0)
AI (40,000) recuce limb damage by 4 (to minimum of 0)
AI (30,000) reduce limb damage by 3 (to minimum of 0)
AI (20,000) reduce limb damage by 2 (to minimum of 0)
AI (10,000) reduce limb damage by 1 (to minimum of 0)
AI (5,000) 50% chance to reduce limb damage by 1 (to minimum of 0)
 
Limb Damage Table (not counting skills that sever or outright destroy limbs)
-----------------------
Success: Based on the chance that skill has to break or damage limbs.
25-40 dmg for an attack dealing at least 50% of the target's PL.
15-24 dmg for an attack dealing at least 25% of a target's PL.
8-14 dmg for an attack dealing at least 10% of a target's PL.
4-7 dmg for an attack dealing at least 5% of a target's PL.

@WArlians all have wings and are natural flyers as a result of this. The
males all have white clear wings that allow for faster movement when flying. 
The females have bright wings with various unique colors that are wider and

ATTACH
------------
Builder's working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.

Usage: attach mob {trigger vnum/name} {mob name} [location]
      
 attach obj {trigger vnum/name} {obj name} [location]
 attach room {trigger vnum/name} {room vnum} [location]

   Attach lets you attach a script to one instance of a mob/obj/room, for
testing or other purposes. The command only attaches the script once, and will
not last over a reboot (or crash). 

   The 'location' is what number in the triggerlist the trigger will assume. 

It is important to first attach a trigger to test before you manually add it
through oedit/medit/redit. 

Examples:
attach room 14500 14520 - Attaches room trigger 14500 to room 14520.
attach mob 1332 santa   - Attaches mob trigger 1332 to mob 1308 (santa).

dagger, sword, club, spear, gun, and lastly brawl. Each different skill is
used for a different type of weapon. Brawl is used for weapons that do not
fall in the 5 main categories. The higher your skill in a category, the better
you are with those weapons when using them in conjunction with the attack
skill. 

You can dual wield (wield two weapons) or wield one weapon with two hands
(Syntax: twohand)

AUCTION BID
----------

   Auction houses are located in each major city of all non-backwater planets.
Items that are auctioned can be bid on for the first 24 hours of being there.
After that all bids are closed and the highest bidder can go to any auction
house to pick up the object. If no one bids on it, the original owner can go
to an auction house and cancel the auction. If the highest bidder doesn't pick
up the object within 6 days the original owner can cancel the auction then. 
If the original owner doesn't cancel it before the 7th day the object is remove
from the auction house forever. 

   When an object is auctioned, canceled from auction, bid on, or picked up an
announcement is sent to all those wearing scouters. 

Syntax In Auction House:
 auction (object) (value)
 cancel
 pickup

Syntax Outside Auction House:
 bid (object) (amount)

AURA-LIGHT
----------

There is now a highly requested feature, aura light. Using this command you
will use your aura to light up the room. 

There are some downsides to using this. You can not powerup, and you can not
charge your ki. You will also lose 15% ki each regen tick. 
 
You also need at least 75 focus and concentration to use it.

AUTOEXIT
----------

Usage: autoexit [ off | normal | complete ]

   Toggles the automatic display of currently available exits. If a door is
closed it will appear @rred@n unless it is a secret door. Secret doors will not
appear at all and will have to be searched for. 

   In 'normal' mode you have a compass and automap. The compass shows the
directions you can go. The automap shows the layout of the surrounding rooms
and what type of rooms they are. 'Complete' removed the compass and automap in
favor of listing the direct ons and their room names. 

Autoexit without a value shows your current autoexit level

BADASS
@c-------------@n
@R(currently not in effect)@n
@nBadass is a special hidden trait that is unlocked when certain specific conditions are met. Earning this trait makes you a certifiable badass like Iovan. There are two different conditions for earning Badass.

@n1) Reach level 100 with no positive traits. You aren't required to take negative traits, for this condition. The bonus for obtaining this version of badass is: 10 points applied to your desired stat (str/con/wis/agl/spd/int) OR a 20% increase to PL/KI/


T

@n2) Reach level 100 with full negative traits. This applies the badass traits mentioned in 1, whilst also NEGATING all negative trait penalties (you still keep the traits for RP reasons, but have overcome them enough to not suffer from them).

target is within its blast area as the attack is focused more on the target.@n
   
@wWith two targets the damage is reduced to 75% to hit a wider area. With 3

BAN UNBAN
----------

@nUsage: 
@Gban [<all | new | select> <site>]@n
@Gunban <site>@n

   @nThese commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game. You may ban a site to ALL, NEW or
SELECT players. Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players from
registering. Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections from that
site. Banning a site selectively allows only players with site-ok flags to log
in from that site. Ban with no argument returns a list of currently banned
sites. 

@nUnban removes the ban.

BANK WITHDRAW DEPOSIT WIRE
----------

   @nThere are different commands to take money out of the bank, put money in the

branch of the First Universal Bank (wherever you see an automatic teller
machine). Money in the bank gains 2% interest every 12 mud days(1 real life
day). 

   @nWhen withdrawing money from a bank a 1% withdraw fee will be charged. The
fee is charged to the rest of the money you have in the bank. If the amount
being withdrawn is 199 zenni or below instead of 1% you will be charged exactly
1 zenni. 

   @nThe wire command will let you wire money to a character you have met. 
Online or offline.

BARRIER
----------
   
@wBarrier is a technique where you take charged Ki and form a sphere of energy
around your body for protection. This sphere can absorb all damage as long as
it has the energy to do so. When a barrier runs out of energy it will burst.
   
Because of the nature of barriers the maximum amount that can be charged
into a barrier is 75% of the user's max Ki. 
   
This technique does not stack with Fireshield.@n

If you fail to dodge or parry you will wish you were better at blocking...
   
If you are fighting without weapons you get a hidden bonus of +4 to all
block skill checks.
   
Block is also a command to attempt to prevent a target from being able to
leave the area. It will depend on the user's speed vs their target's, as well

CANDY CANDYBEAM
----------------------------
   Candybeam is a skill unique to majins. The Majin using Candybeam leans

zig zag of pink energy. If the Candybeam hits, the victim is turned into a
piece of candy ready for consumption. Once consumed, the candy gives a Majin a
boost to their powerlevel, ki, and/or stamina if they are not soft capped. 

   Using candybeam on a target kills the target. 

   Majin now also can use candybeam on the Hyper Gates spread throughout the

------------
   Charge is a command you use to charge your ki in preparation for the use of
ki attacks, as well as some other ki-based techniques. The command takes a
percentage argument. For example, if you have max ki of 10 million and @Rcharge
75@n, this will charge 7. 5 million ki, but may be less if your current ki is
below the value. Your charged ki will gradually drain over time, when held. 
Charging too much ki can render you unable to move. This amount is partially

CLAN-CONTROL
----------

   Clan Control is a concept where a particular clan controls a planet. The
clan that controls a planet gets to choose a bonus that all their clan members
get to enjoy. As long as that clan controls a planet they get to keep that
free bonus. They can only g t one bonus through control. Only good and evil
clans can control a planet as well. Because of this Neutral clans get to
purchase an extra bonus since they are unable to get one through control. 

   Free Planet: In order to control a free planet (one not controlled) the clan
in question must complete 5 RP logs establishing their control. If these logs
contain clan vs clan content or a rival clan is also trying to gain control of
the free planet then the first one to earn a total of 100 RPP from said logs
will gain control of the area. What is RPed to gain control of the planet will
be scrutinized by RP judges to a finer degree than other RP logs. If the logs
in question either do not have enough cla members from the clan vying for
control or does not make sense to the planet then the log may be rejected
entirely. 

   Controlled Planet: In order to free a planet from another clan the attacking
clan must complete 6 RP logs attacking 6 points of importance to that planet.
Read help POI for information on the points of importance for each planet. 
Each RP log must be anno nced 5 days in advance before it is attempted. The
clan that controls the planet (from now refered to as the defending clan) must
respond with their intention to defend within that time period. Then they must
have some of their members present to defend. A passing RP log from the
attacking clan without opposition will get that POI automatically. Once all
six POI fall to the attacking clan then the planet comes under their control.
If the defending clan manages to win in a log involving a POI then the att ck
on it fails

   Controlling All Planets: If you control all the planets your clan and it's
members will be recorded in the hall of fame. The MUD will get to vote on
having a player wipe at that time. The members of the clan that controls all
the planets will get 2 votes each. Every other player in the game will get 1
vote each. If a pwipe is decided it will be carried out the week following the
vote.

CLAN-WARS
----------

   @nClans can now go to @Rwar@n. It goes over a set period (typically a month) and
the winning clan will get 20 RPP for each member (plus whatever logs earned)
and the losing clan will get enough RPP to revive any of its dead members + 2
RPP for each member (and whatever RPP logs earned). Revivals for clans at war
will be suspended except for wish revivals. The clan with the most surviving
members by the end of the war (which must be agreed upon by both clans) wins.
Clans that just hide and never bother to war will be disqualified from the war
with a penalty. (unnamed as of right now)

CLANS
----------

   Clans are a grouping of players who function together in some roleplaying
purpose that their characters have agreed upon either spoken or unspoken. 
Clan members should be loyal to their clan while they remain in it, though they
don't have to be. In fact a good roleplaying plot could be spying on a rival
clan by posing as a member of said clan. 

   Clans also can offer protection and aid for their members. Getting new
members started out on the road of power, or providing muscle to fight off the
clan's enemies. In essence a clan is a good thing you should try to join. 
Standing alone may be badass, but it could be fatal. 

@RRequirements to create a Clan:@n
Minimum 2 players, including founder.
Minimum 40,000 zenni to pay for the clan - can be split or paid solely from the
founder. 
 Clan purpose
 Background
 More fluff
Rp establishing the clan MUST receive passing grade.

Your clan needs to be well thought out and your application, of utmost quality. This and the dynamic of existing clans will factor into whether or not yours will be accepted.

                    @G-Clan Recruitment-@w

   Clan leaders can set their clan to either free or restricted in regards to
recruitment. Free means anyone can join using the clan join <clan name>
command while restricted means that people must apply and have their
application approved. Regardless of what setting a clan has adopted, you must
have obtained a minimum of 5 TRPP (Total Roleplay points) before you can join a
clan. 

                    @G-Clan Maintenance-@w
1: Clans must have at least one clan related RPP posted per month that earns at least 4 RPP. If they do not the clan will lose its right to exist. 

2: Clans can only have a maximum of 10 members unless there is at least one other clan that has 10 members.

3: Every clan related RP posted by a clan (regardless of whether it involves another clan or not) will have 1 RPP recorded for it in a pool. At the end of the month every RPP in a clan's pool will be given to the leader of that clan to distribute amongst


its members.

CLASS
----------
   Race Classification is a system for identifying the strengths and weaknesses
of a particular race. All races in Dragonball Advent Truth have pros and cons.
This help file will explain what classifications there are and what they in
turn mean. 

@RPower@n: A power race is a race that specializes mostly in high powerlevel and stamina. A good example of a power race is saiyans which have the highest transformation threshold.

@CSpecialist@n: A Specialist race is a race that isn't that powerful, but has specialized attributes that help it learn and perform techniques with great skill. These races make up for their lack of brawn with their understanding of technique.

@GSage@n: A sage race has high ki rating and a greater talent with such difficult skills as healing.

@YAbility@n: Ability races are not usually strong or talented, but have built in or acquired abilities unique to their race. These abilities make up for their other shortcomings.

COMBINE
--------------
   Combining attacks is a useful ability that any group can accomplish provided
they know the required skills. The benefits to doing this is an increased
power to the attack (usually), increased accuracy (maybe), and various effects
determined mainly by the leading attack (fired by the leader). The more of a
similar attack that have been merged into the combined attack the more of a
bonus the attack will receive. If all the attacks are the same then an extra
bonus will be added on top of that. 

   Combining attacks is a process that required the FOLLOWERS of the group to
first prepare their attacks. When all the group members have their attacks
ready that is when the LEADER should "prepare" his attack. At that time the
attack will be launched for better or worse. 

   Take note that it is @RILLEGAL@n to organize a group combined attack without
working it out ICly through IC channels. There must exist the possibility that
your opponents will figure out what you are doing. No organizing it OOCly.

COMBOS
-------------
   Combos are possible when using physical attacks. You must wait for a
message that informs you that a combo is possible and what randomly selected
physical attack you need to use next to continue the combo. Each successive
combo hit will increase the damage of the next successful combo hit by 10%. 
This will continue up until your 20th combo hit which will do 8x damage for the
attack used. 

   If you fail to use the attack requested or fail to do enough damage with an
attack then the combo chance will end. 

   You must know three of the following skills before a combo chance will be
offered. Punch, Kick, Knee, Elbow, Uppercut, Roundhouse, Heeldrop, and Slam.

You must also be using one of those skills for an offer to be made.

----------------
* This is an example of a comment in trigedit. Because of the *'s the lines

* The below line sends the text 'Trigger firing' to the room.

Example:

#0
CONTEXT
--------------
Usage: context number
* This little script will make sure one %has_said_hello% exist for each player.
context %actor.id%
set has_said_hello 1
global has_said_hello
* now only scripts running with context = %actor.id% can access this particular 
* variable. however - it's a better idea to use vars set on players: help remote.

   Changes the "context" of a script to this value. When first run, a script's
context is 0. When a variable is made global, it is given the current context.
When a variable is accessed, if it must be searched for globally, a "found"
variable must either have context 0 or the current context. The net result of
this is you may have many global variables in a single script, with the same
name, differing only by context. Players may have variables; this mostly
removes the need for variable context. Previously, a player's ID could be used
as variable context to allow a script to service multiple players at once.

------------
   Create is a technique where the user focuses their ki and materializes an
object into being. How it works exactly is a mystery to all but those who

create different objects will become available to be formed. A very rare and
useful object may be available to the higher skill levels.

CRUSHER-BALL

DC
-----
Usage: dc <descriptor number>

   DC (DisConnect) is used to disconnect a socket. If used on a playing
socket, the player will lose his/her link, but, unlike PURGE, will not extract
the player or dump the player's inventory on the ground. 

   DC is also useful for disconnecting people who have accidentally left
themselves at the main menu, or connections sitting in the "Get name" state.

DEATHBALL
--------------------
   Deathball is a technique invented by the Icerian Royal Family. It was made
most famous by Frieza. The user holds an arm above their head pointing upwards
with their index finger. Then their charged ki pools into an orb above that
finger which grows to a massive size. That large ball of energy is then sent
flying at a target. On critical hits it does four times damage instead of the
usual two. However since it is such a slow moving attack it has a lower than
normal chance of hitting its target.

DEATHBEAM
-------------------
   
@wDeathbeam is a technique developed by the Icerian Royal Family. It was most
famously used by Frieza. The user takes their charged Ki and swiftly channels
it from their index finger toward a target. While not overly powerful compared
to attacks as Kamehameha or Galik Gun, its greatest strength comes from its
speed. Deathbeam is fired so fast and with so little warning that it has a
higher chance to hit a target without them being able to defend themselves.
   
Deathbeam is a perfectable and combinable attack.@n
   
Depending on skill level, Deathbeam will also reduce's the victim's Lifeforce.

DETACH
--------
Builder's working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.

Usage: detach [mob | obj] {target name} {trigger name/vnum | 'all'}
detach room {target vnum | '.'} {trigger name/vnum | 'all'}

   Detach removes a script to one instance of a mob/obj/room, for testing or other purposes. The command only removes the trigger temporarily, until the room/obj/mob is reloaded via reboot, zreset, load.

Use the optional arguments 'mob' and 'obj' to differentiate if more entities with the same alias are in the room.

Examples:
detach room 14500 14520 - remove trigger 14500 from room 14520.
detach room all         - removes all triggers from a room.
detach santa 1332       - detach trigger 1332 from mob 1308 (santa).
detach mob santa all    - detach all triggers from Santa.
detach santa all        - Same as above.
detach sword 1300       - detach trigger 1300 from sword.
detach obj sword 1300   - You guessed it - same as above.
detach sword all        - detach all triggers from the sword.

the shape of the cube even if it is disturbed greatly. The cube will last
until the ki that was supplied to it is too weak to maintain the form. When
that happens the water will rush away and disappear. Anyone in the cube will
be unable to breath unless they are naturally capable of surviving underwater.

DISARM
----------

   Disarm is where an opponent parries an attack and causes his enemy's weapon
to be dropped. This is decided by Strength + Agility + a random number between
-10 and 10 vs the same from the other party. If the one disarming has the
higher roll then the weapon is dropped. Custom weapons are merely dropped to
inventory while all other weapons drop to the ground.

DRAGONBALLS
----------

   The dragonballs are seven mystical orbs created by Kami, and later Dende,
that summon the Eternal Dragon Shenron. Once summoned two wishes may be asked
of Shenron. While capable of fulfilling a great number of wishes there are
some wishes that exceed S enron's ability to grant. The dragonballs are loaded
into the mud in random locations across the the universe. A change from the
show for simplicity's sake. They can be found easier with a dragon radar if
you happen to be lucky enough to have one. Ot er than that diligent searching
is the only other means. Be careful when you go hunting for dragonballs,
conflict is sure to be found as well before Shenron is summoned. Teamwork just
may be your only ticket to getting a wish. 

   @RIf enough selfish wishes have been made then the Dragon Balls will crack and
explode due to the pressure of the selfish energy locked deep inside them. 
When this happens seven Shadow Dragons will be released. Only through
defeating them will the Dragon Balls be restored to the way they were. @n

amount of energy of a single attack. The second attack is strained however and

ENERGIZE
----------

   This is the ability to focus ki from a thrower's fingertips into the thrown
weapon right before it leaves their grasp. This aids the weapon in injuring a
target by surrounding it in an outward (not inward) flow of sharply shaped
energy. It will take 2% of max ki from current ki everytime an object is
thrown while it the technique remains active (until it is toggled off. )
Throwing weapons will gain a damage buff that grows with the user's Energize
skill.

   In order to use Energize you must have throwing chosen as a preference. In
order to learn energize (with throwing as a preference) you must try to use it
once while having at least a skill level of 30 in Focus.

EROTIC-ROLEPLAYING
----------

   Though roleplay of a sexual nature is not forbidden, there are strict rules
on how one may be carried out and with whom. Failure to abide by these rules
will result in swift punishment. This MUD is intended to be a friendly and
enjoyable environment for everyone who wishes to play here. If you fail to
follow the rules, Dragonball AT takes no responsibility for your actions and
you are opening yourself up to the risk of criminal prosecution, and for the
protection of a healthy gaming community and the legal responsibilities of the
MUD's administration, immediate action will be taken, up to and including being
banned from the game.
 
The immortal staff will @RNOT@n stand for any ERP done with someone who is under
 age outside of the MUD. Anyone caught doing so intentionally @RWILL@n be punished.
You agreed to the rules, you will abide by them.
 
These are the rules
        ---
1: Read help Forced Erotica
2: It needs to be done in an out of the way place (as private as you can manage).
3: You MUST be of legal age OOCly to engage in any sort of ERP.

ESCAPE
--------------
Escape is a skill that is used to determine a character's chances of getting past a block. The block in this context is when another character attempts to prevent the escaping character from leaving the room they are in.

Escape is also used to get out of the grasp of anyone absorbing, ingesting, grappling you.

EVAL
----------
Usage: eval <variable> <expression>

* this example immediately evaluates the expression below and stores the result
* in %result%:
eval result %self.hitp% * 100 %self.maxhitp% 
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
* this result will not change after the evaluation even if %self.hitp% changes.

   The eval command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to
the result of the immediate evaluation of the provided expression. There also
exists a "set" command, with the same syntax. Set differs in that the
expression is not evaluated until the variable is accessed.

EVOLUTION
---------------------
   Evolution is a racial ability possessed by Arlians. Arlian exoskeletons and
adrenal glands are capable of evolving continuously throughout their lifespan.
As an arlian takes more damage they begin to develop a better exoskeleton
beneath their current one Once the damage received passes a certain threshold
they shed the old exoskeleton and reveal the new stronger version. This
increases their powerlevel and armor indexes permanently. At the same time
their adrenal glands adapt to function with their improved exoskeleton. This
increases their stamina permanently. 

   Evolution is a passive ability. An arlian just needs to take damage from a
lethal NPC (not spar damage) over a period of time. You can check your
evolution level and evolution experience in the score menu. 

   Your evolution level can not exceed double your character level. Otherwise
you will not advance evolution levels until that changes. 

   Your Armor Index can not exceed 50,000 points. If it does then you will get
no gain for armor index from that evolution. This @RWILL@n count armor worn as
well.

EXPERIENCE XP
----------

   Whenever you kill an NPC or a player, or spar with one, you earn experience
points. When enough experience points are earned you can go to your sensei or
another trainer and 'gain' a level. 

   The amount of experience an NPC gives will depend on its type (animal or
humanoid), its race (saiyan, human, dragon, android, etc. ), and its skillset
(such as Roshi skills). Common humanoid NPCs will give the least experience as
they are technically the easiest enemy to defeat. Androids, Bioandroids,
Majins, Dragons, and Saiyan NPCs all have a bonus to their experience reward.

   Finally you can gain additional experience from an NPC defeated if they
happen to have helped another NPC you had been fighting. The interrupting NPC
will get a 4-5% boost to their experience reward. 

   Additionally there are some items that can affect positively or negatively
your experience gained. One such object is the spar booster found within the
rpp menu. 

EXP gained from mobs is now dependant on how many mobs are in a room at the
time of death. 

1-10 gives the normal ammount of EXP
10-15 reduces EXP by 25%
15-20 reduces EXP by 40%
20-30 reduces EXP by 60%
30+   reduces EXP by 80%

EXTRACT
----------

   Extract is a skill that allows you to extract materials from various
sources. This skill is mostly used on plant and animal parts in order to
obtain an ingredient for other skills (such as Runic). 

   You can now use extract to combine the ink of two Seraf bottles into one. 
Any left over ink is wasted as residue on the discarded bottle though. It is
probably best that you carefully nickname the bottles you want to mix before
mixing them to avoid accidentally targeting bottles that you do not want to
combine. 

Syntax: extract (target)
Syntax: extract combine (bottle1) (bottle2)

FACTION
----------

   In DBAT, factions are similar to clans barring a few exceptions. Factions
are groups that were represented in actual DBZ lore. They are more permanent
than clans (meaning they won't die off, ever) and have a few perks for those
who join them over regular clans. However, membership is much more exclusive
and will be based on immortal approval.' 

The following Factions exist in DBAT:

FEED
--------
   Feed allows one person grouped with another to feed that person a senzu. 
The person they feed a senzu to must not be fighting, they must be grouped with
the one doing the feeding as well. This is mainly for IC teamwork if a
teammate doesn't have a senzu, has no arms, or is unconscious. Any other use
of this should be handled as ICly as possible. 

Syntax: feed (target) (bean)

FIGHTING
----------

   Fighting is unique in Dragonball Advent Truth, as you must manually perform
each attack you wish to do. There isn't a generic attack command(except for
with the use of weapons). As you acquire combat skills you will acquire
various attacks. Learning the basic skill punch for instance will allow you to
use the punch command against a target. Your various combat skills, along with
other factors, will affect how well you do with different attacks. We will not
go into detail as to what effects what because that is something for you to
figure out just as in real life. 
 
   Fighting on DBT uses a unique cooldown system for attacks as well. The
length of cooldown is dependent upon the speed index of the attacker as well as
the base cooldown of the attack. Some factors will lower the cooldown
independent of speed index as well. With all such factors (including speed)
the minimum cooldown of any attack is 1 second.

FINAL-FLASH FLASH
-------------------------------------
   Final Flash is a technique invented and made famous by Vegeta. The user
pulls their arms back to either side and pools charged ki on their palms. 
They then bring both arms forward slamming the wrists together with either hand
facing out palms flat. This attack comes out as a massive wave of energy
rather than a concentrated beam. On critical hits it does triple damage
instead of double.

Fireshield
--------------
   Fireshield is a technique developed by demons long ago to protect their
bodies from enemies while also dealing out horrible pain in retaliation. 
Fireshield has a chance (based on the skill of the user) to prevent ALL damage
of a particular attack. If it does so there is a good chance the fireshield's
energy will be completely used up. Whether the fireshield blocks damage or not
though it will hurt anything that physically touches it. Punch, kick, knee,
elbow, uppercut, roundhouse, heeldrop, and slam will all cause 2% of the
target's maximum ki in damage to the attacker. Rogafufuken doubles this to 4%.
Any weapon that hits a shielded target will take damage while leaving the
attacker undamaged. 

Fireshield and barrier can not be stacked together.

good to bandage wounds that have already been treated recently either. Having
bandaged wounds helps broken limbs to recover faster than normal.

   Fix is a skill used to repair objects that have been damaged. Objects get
damaged in combat, or by being hit by attacks directly. Usually it takes a
while for them to break. You will want to fix things when you can as it will
be cheaper in the long run than buying the same equipment again and again. 
You will need a repair kit to fix anything though.

FORGERY
---------------
   Forgery is a skill used to forge items. This isn't where you smith an item
out of ore, sorry. This is for the thieves, frauds, and general low down
crooks seeking to rip people off. This is making a fake duplicate of an object
you already possess. It won't work like the original(or at all) but it will
look exactly like it in every way. Only your creativity holds the limit to
what can be done with this skill. The appraise skill is what is needed to
determine for sure if something is fake. Or trying to use the item if it has a
function.

FORGET
-------------
   @nThe forget command allows you to forget a skill you know, to free up a skill
begin the process. Only skills whose level is less than 31 can be forgotten.
Once you've used the forget command at your sensei, the skill you chose will show
up in your status and how close it is to being forgotten. To complete the
forget process, you need to practice (not autotrain) 5 skill levels for one or
more skills. You can only forget one skill at a time and tagging another skill
to forget will cancel your current one. 

While forgetting a skill other skills that you practice will cost more PS until that skill is forgotten. This has been true since forget was ever added in to begin with. It is not a bug.

FREEZE THAW
------------------------
Usage: freeze <victim>
       thaw <victim>

   FREEZE, originally invented here at CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent
a player from playing. If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered by
the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW. 
Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary circumstances.

FURY RAGE
----------

   Fury is a racial ability halfbreeds possess that when used increases the
damage physical attacks do and lowers damage received until Fury wear off. 
This is unless a ki attack is used. Which if so that ki attack has its damage
doubled. A ki attack will cause Fury to wear off immediately. Fury can only
be released when it has built up to 100. A halfbreed can save their fury mode
(as long as they don't sleep) and use it when they desire, but only if the fury
gauge is full. Fury will not rise if you are ready to spar. 

   Fury without any argument will fully restore powerlevel for a cost of 20%
max LF taken from current LF. If there is not enough LF whatever was remaining
will be used. 

   Fury attack will only take half of the fury meter. It will only reduce your
rage meter by half, and it will not heal you. The fury damage bonus only
applies to the very next attack afterwards, so make it count.

GARDENING
--------------------
Gardening is an activity that can both be healthy and lucrative. Plants
grown in a garden can be harvested for food and ingredients. The produce
harvested can also be sold for profit. Beware that beginner gardeners should
probably stick to growing the cheaper plants until their mastery of gardening
grows. For those who can afford a leg up the Botanical Compendium will help
any gardener understand how to tend a garden like a pro.

You Will Need:
---------------
@yGardening Clippers@n (for harvesting)
@yGrow Water@n (for watering)
@yGardening Shovel@n (for planting, and digging up)
@yA pile of soil@n (can be obtained via collect, better soil can be found depending on the location. Swamps and forests generally being the best places to check for good soil.)

@GHarvest@D:@w The amount of produce you receive when harvesting depends on the type of plant, quality of soil, and your skill at gardening. Some plants produce very little and some produce a lot. Some are the produce themselves.

@RMaturation@D: @wPlants will be ready for harvest when they say so. They must first pass through several stages of maturation before their "fruit" even begins to grow. A mature plant does not automatically have "fruit" on it.

@CWatering@D:@w You may water plants till they have up to 500 MUD hours of water.
It is important that you keep an eye on your plant's water levels. They will eventually die if they go too long without water.

GENKI-DAMA
----------

   Genki Dama, also known as Spirit Bomb, is a technique invented by King Kai.
The user takes their charged ki and forms a large ball of energy from it. 
This is only the base of the attack though as the main strength of the attack
comes from borrowing energy from others. If you have people grouped with you,
you will get 10% of their ki added to the strength of the attack. Due to its
immense size Genki Damas take a while to hit. This gives your target time to
avoid it if possible. Not only that but they have a chance to overpower the
attack if they are strong enough. However whether it hits them or not(unless
they over power it) it will have a chance to hit others in the room when it
explodes anyway. This attack will not hurt the user or any of their
groupmates. 

   Genki Dama now can not be thrown back by a victim unless that victim is at
least 5 times in current PL as the amount of ki put into the attack. 
Additionally Genki Dama now gets a bonus (calculated after the throw
calculation) of 25% toward the charge it had. This is considered as from the
environment that gave up some life energy toward the attack. 

   Both huge attacks will now aggro ANY NPCs that can fight that are in the
same room. They will aggro against the one who threw it in a desperate bid to
kill them.

GENOCIDE
----------------
   Genocide is an attack invented and made famous by Majin Buu. The true form
of the attack is a massive ball of energy. Due to its size it takes a while to
hit a target, but not as long as a Genki Dama. Since it relies on the user's
charged ki and can't draw out the power of anyone else it gets the advantage of
being boosted by the current strength of the user. A victim of this attack has
a chance to overpower it if they can. If they don't manage to overpower it, or
it hits when the victim is no longer around it will have a chance to damage
everyone else in the room(except the user and his groupmates)

   Genocide now can not be thrown back by a victim unless that victim is at
least 10 times in current PL as the amount of ki put into the attack. Nothing
else about it was changed.

GRAPPLE
------------------------
   Grapple is a skill to grab, hold, or choke an opponent. Depending on the
user's speed vs the target's, the current pl vs current pl, and skill vs bad
luck you may succeed to grapple or not. Those who are being grappled or are
grappling will have the ability to perform other actions hampered or removed
completely while the grapple is in place. 

   Those grappling and being grappled have their speed index reduced to their
speed stat while it is in effect. This matters mostly for those attacking from
outside the grapple. 

Grapple Types/Effects
------------------------------
   Hold: The victim of this and the user can not move or attack while the
grapple is in effect. 

   Choke: The victim loses stamina steadily until they pass out (KO). The
victim is capable of using its full arsenal of attacks while being choked. 
The user is unable to attack at all while performing the choke. 

   Grab: The victim and user are both able to attack each other freely. The
victim and user can't leave while the grapple is in effect. The user gets a
damage bonus. 

   Wrap: This is a grapple only use-able by Majins. They wrap themselves
around the victim and attempt to crush the life out of them. It is like choke
in which the grapple will continue until the victim dies or breaks out, and the
user cannot attack.

GRAVITY
-------------
   In the MUD, there are special objects known as Gravity Generators. These
generators can alter the gravity of the room they are in to make training
(pushups, situps, meditating and sparring) more rewarding. Gravity Generators
are rare but a couple can be found freely available. There are planets and
other natural locations that have a higher gravity as well, such as planet
Vegeta. 

Gravity Generators can be used in two ways:
Type gravity by itself to see a list of settings it can be altered to
Type gravity followed by an argument, to alter the generator to that setting.

@RTraining in gravity your body cannot handle may be lethal, it could leave your
character too exhausted to move, and in a fight that means @rdeath@R. @w

GROUP
----------

Those in a group get a bonus to exp earned from defeating an enemy. The
bonus is +10% for every member of the group. It maxes at 50%.

Usage: group [player]
       group all

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

  Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

  Quifael : "follow dragon"
  Redferne: "follow dragon"
  (Dragon should be following no one but himself)
  Dragon  : "group dragon"
  Dragon  : "group redferne"
  Dragon  : "group quifael"

Or---
@n  Dragon  : "group all"

When you group with your allies, you get a group HUD that shows everyone's
powerlevel, ki, and stamina. To turn it on and off, you use the @Rhealth@n
command. 

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

GROUP-BONUSES
----------

   Grouped characters that are followers now get a +15% exp bonus to exp earned
through the defeat of an enemy. If a group member dies the other members will
get a 25% refill to their current LF for a follower and 40% if the leader dies.
Leaders of groups will get a reward of +1 PS for every enemy the group kills.
Additionally leaders will convey a bonus to all members of the group (other
than the leader) based on the leader's sensei. The bonuses are listed below.

 
Roshi: +2 PS per kill
Krane: +5% exp per kill
Bardock: +10% Physical Damage
Nail: 4% ki recovered per kill
Kibito: 2% pl/ki/st recovered per kill
Sixteen(only android followers benefit): +5% PL recovered if a Repair Android,
+5 Upgrade Points or +15% absorb gains if Powersense, +2% Ki and Stamina recovered if Absorb.
Tapion: +5% dodge and +2% weapon damage
Frieza: +10% Ki damage
Tsuna: Group members that can't breath underwater lose ki at 1/4th normal rate
Piccolo: 4% Stamina recovered per kill
Kurzak: +10% defense against physical
Jinto: +5% Exp per kill if Birth Phase, +10% if Life Phase
Dabura: Immunity to lava rooms

   Groups now have a group victory counter (viewable within status). Every 20
group victories over an NPC or PC (it is counted individually, so someone
joining a group after it has already built up a victory count will have to
build up their own count through participating in the group), anyway after
every 20 victories will add a 2% bonus to the experience earned from the
victory. Up to a max of 16%. This stacks with all other bonuses you may have.
Leaving a group or being kicked out will obviously reset the count to 0.

GUNS
----------

   Guns are technological weapons that shoot things. Whether bullets, energy,
or whatever else we can think of for a weapon. While weapons were not overly
effective in DBZ you will find that they can be here on DBAT. This respects
the wide variety of technology that can be imagined and incorporated into the
game. Below the damage table for gun tiers is listed.

Tier 1: 50 base damage
Tier 2: 200 base damage
Tier 3: 750 base damage
Tier 4: 2,000 base damage
Tier 5: 7,500 base damage

   Gun damage is then further modified by your stats. If your gun skill is 100
or higher then the base damage is multiplied by 2 and added to the original
base amount. If your gun skill is above 50 then the base amount is increased
by 50%. The damage then is multiplied by your agility stat. That number is
then finally multiplied by your character level after it has been divided by 5.

Example: Agility - 100, Gun Skill - 100, Gun of Tier 2, Character level 40
Base Damage 200 + (200 * 2) = 600
600 * 100 = 6,000
6,000 * (40 / 5) = 48,000 dmg (before defenses are calculated)

   Finally if the total damage would exceed 40% of your current max powerlevel
then it will be capped at that amount instead.

   In order to shoot a gun you must have enough zenni on hand. It costs 1
zenni per shot for tier 1, 2 for tier 2, 4 for tier 3, 6 for tier 4, and 12 for
tier 5.

looking for Nail's @RHealing Glow@C skill then type in @Yhelp glow@C
or for information on @RHealing Tanks@C type in @Yhelp htank@D)@n
   
   
Heal is a skill where the user channels their Ki into the cells of either
another character or themselves. This Ki is honed to restore the original
working order of the cells in question. How much healing can be done for a
particular amount of Ki usage depends on the user's skill in healing. 
   
Healing will refill 30% of the target's Lifeforce. Provided their Lifeforce
is below 50% of their Lifeforce max. This Lifeforce refill only affects
others. Not the user even if the user target's their own body.
   
Depending on skill level, it refills Stamina. The following
bonus is only applicable to Nail's students.

HEALING-GLOW
-----------------------
   This skill, which has been handed down throughout the generations of
Namekian sages, is one of the most advanced techniques in the universe. With
focused preparation of the user's ki one can strengthen their body's life
force. While healing glow is in effect the normal Life Force to PL regen will
not cost Life Force. The duration depends on the skill of the user and a small
random factor. The minimum time that the skill lasts is one mud hour.

HEALING-TANK HTANK
----------------------------------
   Healing tanks are devices that specialize in repairing the injuries on their
occupants. They are large enough to hold just about any size of humanoid,
fully submerging them in its special healing liquids. Healing tanks greatly
increase the speed of regeneration, allowing evenly the most heavily damaged
warriors to recover in short periods of time. There is a downside however,
Healing tanks run on energy, which depletes as an injured occupant is healed.
If there is no energy in the healing tank you will be unable to use it until it
has recharged for at least one regeneration cycle. It can hold a maximum of 20
regeneration cycles at a time. 

Healing tanks can usually only be found on private ships, and only then if they were purchased by the ship owner. Healing tanks are a must have for those enduring intense training.

HEAVENLY-KAIOS
----------

   The Heavenly Kaios is a faction that was represented in DBZ/GT and is also
represented in DBAT. It is the group referred to in help kai that is
responsible for protecting and the running of the universe. Originally only
pure hearted Kaios were applicable to join but due to the Makai conflict on
Aether, replenishing the order has become difficult, meaning a pure hearted
member of any race may be applicable to join. The faction is made up of five
individuals, the Supreme Kai at the top of the order as well as four guardians,
of which King Kai is one (North Kai). The supreme kai rank is and always will
be, kai only. 

To join the Heavenly Kaios, one must pass a series of trials to prove their
worth. 

Members of the faction get the following perks:

HEDIT
----------
   Hedit is the command used to write help files. It is restricted to level 3
and higher imms. How it works is simple. If you are editing a help file that
ALREADY exists you can ignore the keywords section of hedit. If you are
editing a NEW help file, you should write the help entry FIRST. Format it to
your liking, and then after saving the entry enter the keywords via the menu.
The keywords will then be automaticly added to the helpfile entry's top. Be
careful with the keywords section of the menu as it WILL edit the top two lines
of the help file but it WON'T delete previous keywords on the file. It will
just push them down and make them part of the entry. This will make your help
file unpleasant to the eyes. You should test hedit out on a file you will not
be saving first to see how it works before editing ANY existing files or
writing ANY new files.

HEELDROP
----------------
   Heeldrop is the highest level lower body attack. The user swings their heel
up and down on a target in an axe kick. It can knock an enemy out of the air
if they are flying, but can't knock them out like slam can. It does more
damage than slam and has a very good chance of destroying a limb if it hits
one. Everything else between it and slam being equal.

HELL-SPEAR-BLAST
----------

   Hell Spear Blast is a technique where the user raises their hand above their
head and forms a spear of energy. They grasp the spear with the hand that
formed it and throw it at the ground. When the spear hits the ground it
explodes covering a wide radius with its blast. @RIt will hit friends and
enemies alike but never the user. @n Caution is necessary when using it around
allies. It has the chance to knock victims off their feet if they do not
happen to be flying when the blast occurs.

HELL-SPIRAL
------------------
   Hell Spiral is an android technique taught by Android 18. This technique
has the user hold their hand out in front of them with the palm facing upward.
They then pool their charged ki into their palm and form a large red orb Once
the orb is complete they quickly withdraw their hand and punch the orb into a
target. This technique strikes with an increased force due to the violence of
its launch and the density of the ki used to form it. It has an incredible
chance to break or destroy limbs it hits. As a final benefit to the technique
it gets a boost to its damage based on how advanced the android that uses it
is.

HONOO
------------
   
@wHonoo is a technique invented by the King of Demons, Dabura. The user takes
their charged Ki and mixes it with the air in their lungs. The Ki changes the
air, using the hydrogen atoms and oxygen to create fire with a temperature
greater than 1000 degrees celsius. The user's Ki protects their insides from
the heat of the flame until it has been spewed out of the mouth. The range of
this attack is actually pretty good. There is a good chance that a target
engulfed in its flames will be burned badly which will hamper their ability to
heal until the burns have been healed first.

HOSHIJIN2
----------

   The Hoshijin are one of the oldest races in the known galaxy and perhaps the
first to take to the stars, whose original home world was located near the
galactic center. Those that are willing to 'sing' the story of their origins
tell of how they left their home world because it was dying. Their home world
suffered an environmental catastrophe due to a mixture of overpopulation and
centuries of using industry that generated mass amounts of pollution. Those
that were able to, fled via spacecraft though man couldn't and the majority of
the Hoshijin population are presumed to have died off. 

   The remnants of the Hoshijin people traveled throughout the galaxy looking
for new places to settle. It is through this travel and inability to find
anywhere to settle and call their new home world, that their current name is
derived from. During this time the Eldritch star, which is central to the
Hoshijin religion, was discovered. Sitting in a system which had no habitable
worlds, the Eldritch Star gave off rays of energy that seemed to subtlety alter
the abilities of the Hoshijin depending on where they were. If it was in
alignment with a planet, that ability would be strengthened. 

   Many of the Hoshijin hoping to gain vastly superior power journeyed to the
Eldritch Star itself. Those that did, died excruciating deaths, as it seemed
exposure so close to the star overwhelmed them. Those who had not made the
journey began to chart the ravels of the Eldritch Star, making notes on which
worlds it aligned with and when. Over the years, this led the star to becoming
a central icon in the Hoshijin religion. Those who were extremely fervent
would follow it's course and gain the most benefit . Others made the travels
less often, instead choosing to settle on a world for a time and assist there
before moving on. 

   The Hoshijin population in modern times is quite small and groups of them
larger than 20 are practically unheard of. They are secretive in nature,
hiding their true origins and religion from other races. Due to their
abilities, they are also able to conceal their true forms and very rarely
voluntarily reveal them. 

@CGeneral Description@n

   In their true form, Hoshijin appear humanoid, their average height being
slightly taller than that of Humans. Their is skin translucent in well-lit
areas which gives them a wraith or ghost-like appearance. The features and
form of a Hoshijin are both sle der and lithe, giving a natural eloquence to
their appearance. The males of the species all appear bald, unable to grow
head hair. Something that doesn't affect the female gender. A common cultural
practice amongst the Hoshijin is to tattoo their bodies ith
 glyphs from their ancient language.

HOUSES
----------

Houses are nice places to rest your head, keep extra items safe (all its rooms save items), and basically have your own personal space. Acquiring a house costs money though and they can only be obtained at a special house shop in the Space Mall.

   @CBasic House Capsule@D:@w This house comes with four rooms Bedroom (+25% regen),
Workout Room (increased exercise/spar gains), Kitchen (kitchen appliances will
only work here), and entrance hallway. 

   @CDeluxe House Capsule@D: @wThis house comes with an extra room over the basic
house. This room is an indoor garden which can house up to 8 growing plants.

   @CExcel House Capsule@D @w This house has the same number of rooms as the Deluxe
except that the indoor garden is larger and holds up to 20 growing plants. 
The workout room and bedroom bonuses are also better than either Deluxe or
Basic houses.

   From now on all characters are subject to an unseeen "at ease" penalty for
being in houses for too long. What this does is lower the chances of getting a
spar gain, increase the costs of pushup/situp/meditate (not expand), and
increase the cost of training stats. The rate all of these are affected is
based on how many regen ticks you have been in a house, with four different
ranges. 
 
   @RRanges@n
@W-------------------------@n
   @C0-115 Ticks@D:@W No penalties. 
   @C116-231 Ticks@D:@W 20% lower chance to get a spar gain, x4 cost for
pushup/situp/med, x2 cost for training stats. 
   @C232-464 Ticks@D:@W 50% lower chance to get a spar gain, x15 cost for
pushup/situp/med, x5 cost for training stats. 
   @C465+ Ticks@D:@W 0% chance to get a spar gain, x50 cost for pushup/situp/med, x10
cost for training stats. @n
  On top of this if you are in stage 2 and you go outside for a tick your "at ease" count will drop at double the rate it rises at (so 2 ticks for 1).  Third stage is double again (4 for 1). This is to make the wait to be able to return not be nearly as 
ntense. Note though that once you drop from one stage to another the rate of decline will change to that stage's. So from stage 3 to 2 will have it go from 4 ticks for 1 to 2 for 1.

HSEDIT
-----------
   House Edit is used to build houses, clan vaults, or ship storage bays. 
Houses are to be owned by the player who purchases them. Clan vaults must be
flagged as a clan room and owned by Clanman(an unused player file). Ships
storage bays must be an unowned room and "owned" by Shipman(who is like
clansman). All "house" rooms must have an atrium which needs to be an exit
connected to the room you used house edit in. The rest of house edit is self
explanatory I would hope. If you need any help further just ask Iovan.

HYDROMANCY
----------

   This ability is reserved for Kanassans who are students of Tsuna. It relies
upon their Fighting Art "Sacred Tsunami" and allows them to control the water
around them for different purposes. All hydromancy that use the hydromancy
command directly require ater to already be in the room. They do not create
water out of ki. 

   Hydromancy flood will attempt to wash everything in the current room in
another room's direction. This will hurt them and move them to that room. On
top of that the other room can become flooded in a similar manner as Dimizu
Toride. Kanassans and those t at maintain their balance will not be affected
by this ability. 

   Hydromancy spike will create a throwable ice spike. These will melt slowly
until they melt away completely. They work like all other throwing weapons
only with the addition of small stamina drain on targets affected by the cold.
Icers and Androids are im une to the cold stamina drain. Demons are immune to
ice weapons, period.

HYOGA-KABE KABE
-----------------------------
   Hyoga Kabe (Glacial Wall) is a Hydromancy technique that forms a wall of
water from the user's ki. That wall of water then freezes solid. The wall
while it lasts completely blocks off a direction to the room the user used it
in. For example if the technique is used to block off the north exit of a room
then the wall is formed in the room the north direction connects to and forms a
wall blocking the south exit of that room (which leads to the north exit of the
Room the technique was used in). These walls will melt of their own accord
(slowly) over time. They can also be attacked and destroyed. Their durability
depends on the intelligence, wisdom, ki, and skill of the user. However a user
of the skill can just dissolve a wall by using the skill on it again.

IceCrownCity
------------------

   This city was constructed in the extinct volcano known as Ice Crown, on the
planet Frigid. It has a unique architecture and is divided into 4 levels. 
The abandoned level of Ice Crown City was once a residential district, but now
serves as a prison for the entire planet. The lower level is known as the
Residential District, which is the largest single residential area on Frigid.

You can find most public services here and an exit out of Ice Crown. The
middle level, is the Commercial district and the majority of Ice Crown's
merchants have set up shop here. The top level is where the rich and powerful
live, separate from the riff raff below. The complex is connected via an
elevator system that operates in the main volcano shaft which can be found in
the center of every district. This elevator can also take the rider to a 5th
floor, which is the Caldera of Ice Crown, where the Royal Palace can be found.

finds the end of the block. If it is false, it continues searching in the same
pattern, until a true elseif is found, an else is found, or an end is found. 
There may be 0 or 1 else statements and 0 or many elseif statements in the
block. For anyone having trouble with the format of if/elseif/else/end blocks
@RTSTAT 22@n. Relsqui made this excellent example.

be. Placing the limb near a missing limb's location will cause it to
automaticly transform into the desired size and shape. It then attaches itself
to the stump. You can target others with implant as well if they are incapable
of using implant themselves due to no... Arms.

Ingests has a separate chance for each skill known to increase by 
1 and a higher chance for any skills shared between the Majin and the one
ingested by 10. If this happens to be a grand-master of the skill the Majin 
will cap out at 101 of that skill.
   
Ingest attempts can be avoided if the speed index of the victim is higher.@n

INSTANT-TRANSMISSION
------------------------------------
   Instant Transmission is a skill that allows the user to teleport themselves
to a target. The user has to be able to both sense and be able TO sense the
target to achieve this. The distance you can travel with Instant Transmission
depends on your skill le el in it. The ki cost it requires depends on your
skill level as well. You can not Instant Transmission when dead and you can't
Instant Transmission to anyone who is dead. This is done for balance. For
this same reason you can't IT into a sensei area. 

If the user of Instant Transmission is grappling with someone or being grappled with by someone they will bring the other with them when using the skill.

INVASION
----------

   Invasion is one of the perks of the World Trade Organization. A high
ranking member may request an invasion of a planet to an Immortal. Provided
there is not already an invasion going on and one wasn't requested two weeks
prior to current request, the in asion will be granted. 

   This is represented by NPCs loyal to the faction being present on the target
world that help with the process of taking over a world. If an invasion is
successful, they will remain as guards of the planet. An invasion may be
cancelled by the same high ra king member who called it, after a week has
passed.

IOVAN
----------
   Iovan is the coder and owner of Dragonball Advent Truth. Nearly everything
you use was touched by his coding fingertips. He is usually busy, so try not
to bother him unless you really need to. However if it is important feel free
to message, mudmail, email, or smoke signal him. 

   You will rarely see Iovan. Some say that this is because he doesn't truly
exist, and others say that he exists only in your heart, but the truth is
Iovan's squandering his free time doing something unproductive. If you happen
to come across one of the poor unfortunates who wait for Iovan to show, be kind
to them, and remind them that if they search their heart maybe Iovan will be
found.

KAIOKEN
----------

   Kaioken is a skill invented by King Kai of the North Galaxy. It is a
technique where the user compresses their ki into their body increasing their
strength and speed. It has different levels, determined by how much ki is
compressed this way. Depending on the level and the strength of the user the
Kaioken technique can hurt the body. 

   There are 20 levels of Kaioken in all. It is best to start at the lower
ones and work your way up so your body doesn't give out with the technique
failing. How successfully you can first achieve a kaioken level depends on
your skill and the level of kaioken being attempted. How long you can hold a
kaioken level depends on your overall skill or if you have taken a sufficient
amount of damage while in a kaioken state. 

   Kaioken not only raises your current powerlevel for a period of time, but it
also increases the amount of damage you can do when performing attacks. Not
only that but it raises your speed index as well. 
Syntax: kaioken 1-20

kakusanha
----------

KAKUSANHA
------------------
   Kakusanha is a technique invented and made famous by Krillin. The user
fires a large beam of golden energy toward an assumed target. Then they
manipulate the beam to arc upwards where it splits into five separate beams
that follow up to five targets. If only one target is hit that target will
take full damage. If two targets they will each take 60%. For three or more
it will be 40%. The technique will not hit those who are grouped with the user
and if there are fewer than five targets the extra beams will slam into the
ground instead.

KIATTACKS
----------

   Ki attacks are ranked by a tier system. Different attacks have different
effects, bonuses, strength level, and so on. This determines what tier they
are ranked in. While attacks within the same tier may differ from each other
there is sometimes something they all share. 

   The tier ranking system will be explained a little bit below. While to find
out the bonuses/effects a particular skill may have individually you should
look at that particular skill's help file. This will just cover what skills in
a tier share with each ther. 
@cTier 1@n
------
   Skills in this range are the most basic of the basic. When striking a limb
they have the least chance of destroying that limb. They have the weakest
maximum power but have the lowest cooldown time after use. 

@cTier 2@n
------
   Skills in this range are more specialised and generally carry a higher
maximum power than anything tier 1 has to offer. They have 10% higher chance
of destroying a limb if they hit it than Tier 1 skills. 

@cTier 3@n
------
   Skills in this range either have a very special use, or have a higher
maximum power rating than Tier 2 attacks. They have AT LEAST 20% higher chance
of destroying a limb if they hit it than Tier 1 skills. 

@cTier 4@n
------
   Skills in this range have a higher maximum power rating than Tier 3
attacks(Sometimes greatly higher), and special effects. They have AT LEAST 30%
higher chance of destroying a limb if they hit it than Tier 1 skills. 

@cTier 5@n
------
   Skills in this range are the best of the best. They have no limit to the ki
that can be put into them and either have a special effect or additional ways
to charge the skill. These attacks take a while to prepare leaving the user
defenseless in the meant me.

KOTEIRU-BAKUHA BAKUHA
----------------------------------------
   Koteiru Bakuha (Frozen Blast) is a Hydromancy technique where the user
creates a large amount of water. They create this water while performing a
short dance that has the water floating and swirling around their body. They
then launch the water at a target and instantly freeze it upon impact. This is
the strongest Hydromancy technique and has a 1 in 4 chance to freeze a target
solid for a short time. It's not as damaging as other skills of its tier class
but it makes up for that with its unique effect.

LEGENDARY LSSJ
----------

   Legendary Super Saiyans are not exactly like Broly from the movies bearing
his name. Instead of being limited to once every thousand years or so there is
a small chance upon creation of a saiyan character to be born a Legendary Super
Saiyan. If your Saiyan is lucky enough they will be gifted with two
transformations instead of the usual four. However their transformations will
not drain stamina and they have a bit of a difference between them and other
saiyan transformations. 

   The first transformation they get is Super Saiyan First. They happen to get
this transformation a lot sooner though while still getting the same amount of
boost from it as a normal saiyan. Their second transformation is the Legendary
Super Saiyan form. This form is on par strength wise as Super Saiyan Fourth
but earned far sooner and with no stamina drain.

LEVELS
----------
   
@wUsage: levels@n
@wSyntax@Y:@y Gain@n
   
@wThis command lists the levels you can gain throughout your playtime on the
game and what experience is required to attain each level. Levels provide your
character with percentage based boosts to PL/KI/STA as well as new Practice
Sessions with each level. 
   
Some levels give higher than average boosts as a bonus, those levels
will be detailed below.
   
Level 100 gains no exp. However instead you have a good chance to gain 1/6th
the EXP to PL/KI/ or STA
   
At level 15 and above it costs RPP to gain a level. The amount of RPP that
is required is listed in score underneath the experience listing. On levels
that significant soft-cap ranges are found (such as 31, 41, etc. ) there is no
RPP cost to level. Finally on even levels the cost is reduced by 1.
   
To gain a level, the "@ygain@w" command is used@n
   
@wBoost Levels: 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.@n

LIFEFORCE
----------

   Life Force is the amount of life your character still has in them. The way
it works is as long as you have Life Force left you have a good chance to
regain PL every few seconds while fighting. What you regain will be a portion
of your Life Force pool (seen on the score sheet. ) Life Force total is
determined by 50% of the max Ki and max Stamina of the character in question
(added together. )

   It will not rise when you transform, but will only be maxed out if you have
slept for at least one regen tick. Resting will refill 15% of your max
lifeforce per tick rested. Either sleeping or resting will ONLY refill
lifeforce if you did not heal to full @RPOWERLEVEL@n for that tick. Advanced
cooking meals will fill up lifeforce as well. 

   The amount of PL refilled is equal to 5% of the max life force that
character would have if they slept. This would be 50% of max Ki plus 50% of
max Stamina. 

   Now if a player is hit with a fatal non-sparring attack and has life force
enough left to weather the remaining damage (after substracting your remaining
PL) then you will cling to life, and recover a small amount of your PL at that
moment. The amount recovered is either 5% of your Life Force maximum, if you
have the LF for it after the damage has been calculated, or your level x 100
(example: level 50 x 100 = 5,000 PL). When your Life Force runs out, then you
die.
   
   The life command can be used to set the percentage of your optimal PL that
you want your Life Force to kick in at. Zero will set it off completely. 
This gives you complete control over how your LIfe Force works for you.

LIGHT-GRENADE
----------

   Light Grenade is a technique developed by Piccolo. The user cups their
hands horizontally in front of their body and quickly charge a golden orb of
energy. The attack is then launched at a single target where it explodes into
a forward rushing wide blast of energy. The target is hit for the full damage
of the ki put into it (minus defenses) and anyone else caught in the blast is
hit for half that damage (minus defenses). Group mates are not affected by
this attack.

LINK
----------

   A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course. 

   I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each time
someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then you will be saved by
divine forces, and put in a safe place until you reconnect to the game. 

   II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem. The only solution we
can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By breaking the
link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated. 

   Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link. You will be not
reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully cut your link.

powerlevel. This majinized victim can not attack the one who majinized
them(their master) unless they are released from their majinization. To
majinize someone they must be close to your alignment as well as following the
user to prevent abuse.

MASENKO
----------
   
@wMasenko is an attack invented by Piccolo, though it was most famously used
by his student Gohan. When using Masenko the practitioner places both hands on
top of each other and raises them up above and slightly behind their head with
their palms facing outward. They then bring both hand forward aimed at their
target and fire a large beam. The Masenko beam's damage is mainly found in the
large ball of energy at the front of the attack. This attack is equivalent to
Kamehameha in damage, but also has the occasional effect of draining some of
the victim's stamina.
   
Masenko is a perfectable and combinable attack. 
   
Depending on skill level, it gains a boost to DMG based on your max Ki. The 
following bonus is only applicable to Piccolo students.@n

MODEL
----------

   Android Models: The base abilities of an android are determined by their
model type. There are three model types; Absorb android, Repair androids, and
Sense androids. 

   @CAbsorb @cModel@D:@w Can not be upgraded, but has special mechanisms built into
their hands to absorb energy from other living beings. 

   @GRepair @cModel@D:@w Can be upgraded, have the ability to repair, and the ability
to recharge their energy. 

   @RSense @cModel@D:@w Have the ability to perfectly sense a target's location, if up
close their powerlevel, can be upgraded, gain upgrade points faster than repair
models, has a higher chance of being protected by Nanite Armor, and start out
with high powerlevel/ki/stamina.

MOLECULE NARCISSIST SAELLYN
----------

   Molecule is the prime example of a narcissist. Feeding his ego will ensure
you safety and ability to live. Destroying his ego will help the lulz to
ensue. 

Things to remember: Don't feed caged animals.

Addendum: Saellyn is another prime example of this.

MOON OOZARU
----------

   Oozaru or the Great Ape form as it is also known is a genetic trait that
those with saiyan blood possess. When witnessing the full image of a celestial
body they absorb blutz waves and transform into a large ape. This only happens
if they still have their saiyan tail. When the body in question goes away so
does the blutz waves and they revert to normal. If their tail is removed they
also return to normal. 

The following planets have moons which enable Oozaru
----------------------------------------------------------
Earth
Vegeta
Frigid
Aether

   Full moons happen to appear on the nights of the 20th-22nd of every month.
Why all moons of these planets do it at those times and never in a progressing
schedule of lunar orbits is a mystery. Some blame it on Iovan. Don't listen
to peer pressure and choose to disbelieve those fools.

MOONDUST
----------

   This is an ability that only female arlians are capable of. It uses 2% of
their Lifeforce max taken from stamina to refill the PL of themselves and
anyone they are grouped with. The 2% multiplied by 3 for the healing amount.
The success chance of moondust depends on the user's wisdom + 1d10 vs 2d60.

MULTIFORM
----------

   Multiform is a skill that allows the user to split their body into multiple
copies. Each copy is the same strength as the others based on the strength of
the original reduced by 25% Base PL, KI, or ST for each clone. Permanant
transformation races have this amount multiplied by their transformations while
races without permanent transes are unable to use the skill while transform or
to transform while using it.

Syntax: multi (split | merge)

MULTIHIT
----------

   Multihit is where you manage to attack fast enough to throw out an
additional hit right after a hit you chose to throw. This only applies to hand
to hand, foot to face, and weapon based attacks. Your chances to multihit
depend on your agility and speed index. Weapons lower your chances to multihit
by 25%.

MULTITHROW
----------

   Multithrow is an additional perk of Throw that allows the user to throw

or not.

MYSTIC-MUSIC MUSIC
----------

   Tapion now has the skill (one skill slot) mystic music, which allows you to
use the song command as long as you have an ocarina. Tapion students can buy
one from Minosha. 

   The way songs work is that the character starts playing a song, nothing
happens immediately (unless you get very lucky), but instead every 15 seconds
the songs effect takes place. It only ends if the musician runs out of ki or
in the case of teleport has successfully teleported. 

   Songs will never fail when first used (when you begin playing), but instead
skill is checked vs a pair of axion dice (with a small modifier for the best
songs) each song cycle to see if the song was played correctly. If it was then
everyone grouped with the musician (or not grouped, in the case of Shadow
Stitch) gets the effect (with a small cost of ki per affected group member,
except for teleport). If the musician fails then there is just a failure
message, no cost, and they continue playing. You can not attack while playing
a song. 
 
Songs
----------
   Song of Safety: Heals PL based on a percentage of the musician's max ki,
their skill with mystic music, and a base amount. Stamina is restored for half
of the amount of PL that gets restored. To top all this off the limb condition
of all limbs is restored by as much as 11% each song cycle. 
 
   Shadow Stitch Minuet: If this succeeds it lags non-grouped player characters
by 2 seconds or permanantly subtracts 2 speed from NPCs. 
 
   Teleportation Melody: If this succeeds the entire group is teleported
instantly to the planet of the musician's choosing. 
 
   Song of Shielding: If this succeeds on a song cycle the affected group
members get a barrier worth 15% of the musician's max ki. If they have their
own barrier the 15% is added to it instead. If their barrier is at or equal to
75% of THEIR max ki then it stays capped at 75% instead.

Syntax: song (shielding | safety | teleport | shadow )

NANITE-ARMOR
----------

   Nanite Armor is a skill that determines the success rate an android has to
deploy their nano robotic mechanisms to form armor at the point of impact for
an attack. The higher their skill in this the more often they will be able to
intercept an attack with their nanite armor and reduce damage received. The
damage received is reduced based on how advanced the android is. 

Damage Reduction

Always use /f to format and indent your trigger. This will warn you if you
do not have the correct number of ifs to ends. @RWARNING:@n multiple unmatched
if/ends will crash us. Make sure everything lines up with /f before you test.

#1
OASIS
----------

   OasisOLC is the name given to a set of on line editing tools that can be
used by authorized players to examine, change and create the various world
entities that make up the Mud environment. It is referred to as "on line"
creation because it allows people to create and edit things while the mud is
running, or on line. This is opposed to the traditional method of editing the
various text files that comprise the mud "world" using various off-line editors
(typically vi or emacs), and the restarting the mud so that the updated files
are reloaded. 

Categories of Oasis Commands
------------------------------------------
1)  Commands to examine the existing mud operation.  These are the [x]list commands, that can be used to view a 
range of world objects, and give a summary of their descriptions.  The actual commands are:
    mlist - List Mobiles               slist - List Shops
    olist - List Objects               zlist - List Zones
    rlist - List Rooms

2)  Commands to change or create entities and mud operation values.  The commands are:
    aedit - Actions (socials) editor   redit - Room editor
    cedit - Configuration editor       sedit - Shop editor
    medit - Mobile editor              tedit - Text file editor
    oedit - Object editor              zedit - Zone editor

3)  Miscellaneous commands.
    buildwalk - Create rooms by walking around
    dig       - Open exits between two rooms
    rclone    - Create a copy of a room
    saveall   - Writes al outstanding changes to disk

Using the Editing Commands
--------------------------

   All of the edit commands are menu driven. See OASIS-EDIT for general
instructions on how the menu interface works. 

Granting Access to Oasis Commands
---------------------------------

   Access to the Oasis commands are controlled through a number of means. Of
course, the master command list (in interpreter. C) specifies the minimum
level for a player to call the command. This is typically set to either
LVL_BUILDER, or LVL_GOD. A few commands are restricted to the implementor. 

   A player can always edit a zone and its contents if their name is in the
zone builders list (see ZEDIT for more information). Finally, a player may be
granted OLC rights to a specific zone by means of the "set" command, using "set
<player> olc <zone>". 

The implementor has unfettered access to all Oasis commands.

External Documentation
----------------------

   Refer to "The CircleMUD Builder's Manual" that is shipped with the CircleMUD
distribution, as this provides considerable invaluable information that is
essential to anyone building on a mud, whether off-line or using Oasis. The
main reference documentation for OasisOLC can be found at:

     http://dgscripts.n3.net/

OASIS-EDIT
----------

   The OasisOLC edit programs make use of a menu interface, and each of the
various commands has a similar appearance. Each attribute of the thing you are
editing is listed, with a menu number against it. These numbers start from the
number 1, run through the digits to 9, then use the letters A onwards. You
enter the number (or letter) corresponding to the item you wish to change. 
Some menu items will lead to sub-menus, for example setting various bit fields.
Some menu items will lead to sub-menus, for example setting various bit fields.

   In general, the letter "Q" will quit (with the option to save) the menu
level you are currently at, although some sub-menus use the number "0" to leave
the menu. 

Types of Menu Items
-------------------

   1) Single value items. These correspond to attributes that have a single
value or a simple list. For example, a room name, an object's weight, or the
list of aliases for a mobile. Enter the value(s) and press the return key. 

   2) Long text fields. This corresponds to a multi-line text string, such as
a room's description. This makes use of the "enhanced edit" text editor. Use
the "/h" command in the editor to see the various options. 

   3) Multi-value fields. This is a menu item where you have to enter several
values, such as an object's value flags, where there can be up to four values
that you have to enter. Each value will have its own prompt, so enter the
value as directed by the prompt, and press the return key. 

   4) Bit string fields. This menu item goes to a sub-menu, with all of the
possible bit values listed. You can select as many values as you wish, with
each menu number on this sub-menu toggling its corresponding flag on and off.
Use the menu item "0" once you have set all the flags you require to return to
the top menu. 

   5) Multiple choice fields. This is where the attribute has one of a number
of possible values, such as an object's type or a room's sector type. The
sub-menu will list all the possible values, so to choose the value you want,
enter the menu item number that corresponds to the particular choice you want.
This is unlike the bit string field, in that once you make a choice, that value
is recorded and you are returned to the upper menu. 

   6) Sub menus. Selecting this menu option takes you to a sub-menu where a
new set of menu items are listed. Once you have finished working at this
sub-menu level, generally 0 or Q will return you to the upper menu. 

Saving Your Changes
-------------------

   If you have changed the thing you are working on in any way, taking the "Q"
option from the top-most menu will save the object, if you respond with a "Y"
at the save object prompt.

PERSONAE-AND-RELATIONS
----------

@RNote: In regards to personality, this is only a general guideline. We are not
forcing you to roleplay what is outlined here. @n

   @CSaiyans@n are a proud warrior race with an intense love of battle. Generally
speaking they look down on other races and this is especially more evident the
higher up a saiyan is born into their caste system. Elites and Royalty tend to
be extremely arrogant and demeaning towards other species and even those of
lesser classes amongst their own kind. Saiyans have no particularly like or
dislike of any race but tend to view half-breeds (half saiyan, half human) in a
rather distasteful manner. Showing ones strength through battle could win the
friendship of an individual saiyan. 

Dislikes; Half-breed - mockery of saiyans/not pure blooded.

   @CHumans@n are relatively new to the space faring game in comparison to a lot of
the other established races and although society has come to accept "aliens"
amongst them, there is still strong factions of xenophobia that could stem from
the fact the Human species in the past were racist in a similar way that
Saiyans are with their class system. Next to Mutants, Humans are undeniably
the most varied species in the known galaxy, with so many different personality
archetypes and appearances there cannot be any true generalisation of them
beyond they tend to be cunning and have shown time and again they able to
overcome every obstacle thrown at them. 

   -Cold War w/ Icers: There is a desire in the government of Earth to become
the big boy of the galaxy, the leading light for all overs to follow. To this
end, they have begun stockpiling arms and preparing to go to war with the Icers
(lead by the WTO). The Icers are known as slavers among many other things
which Human Governments are strongly against. 

   Demeaning and arrogant, @CIcers@n don't just think they are better than you,
they know it. The harshness of their home planet has impacted profoundly on
their personalities and culture, forging them into a harsh and ruthless
species. Outwardly they appear to have no care in other species but Mutants
seem to hold a soft spot for them as their "favored slaves". Their slaving
operations and aggressive world conquering has left relationships with just
about every other race particularly sour. 

   -Cold War w/ Humans- Earth is an untapped resource as far as the WTO is
concerned. That and they of the belief that the Humans may develop to a point
of being able to challenge their power. No official attacks have been made but
Earth has the WTO's attention. 

   -War w/ Namek: A small invasion of Planet Namek has begun. Reasons behind
it are unknown but only a fraction of the WTO's forces have been committed
believing Namek an easy target.

PERSONAE2
----------

   @RNote: In regards to personality, this is only a general guideline. We are
not forcing you to roleplay what is outlined here. @n

   @CNamekians@n are generally a peaceful race composing of sages and farmers. 
Although possessing strong and well trained warriors, they do not actively
pursue conflict. Despite the agrarian culture of the Nameks, they have
actually had space faring vessels for a long period of time. They tend not to
leave the planet however unless there is a reason to do so. Icers have invaded
planet Namek and initiated war with the Namekians for control of the planet. 
Because of this, Namekians have come to dislike Icers and the World Trade
Organisation. 

   More of an umbrella of races, rather than an individual one, @CMutants@n are the
most varying in terms of appearance and personality in the galaxy. However
many mutants have been integrated into Icerian culture either as slaves or
other ways and taken upon similar fierce personas. Some mutants believe that
working for the Icers is the best way to further their own species, while
others detest the widespread slavery of Mutants. 

   @CTruffles@n are the most advanced technological species in the galaxy. Due to
events that have caused them to lose their home world, Truffles have a burning
desire for revenge and utter contempt for the Saiyans, of whom conquered their
world. Most Truffles are happy to lead people on in the belief they fled their
home planet and are the last of their kind, until they can trust their
companions enough. A trust which isn't earned easily. Peaceful by nature,
they secretly perform small scale military actions throughout the galaxy,
presumably to either recover old Truffle Technology or prevent it by whatever
means falling into hands that would misuse it (Like the Hyper-gates). 

   While not at a point where they can hope to retake their home world from the
Saiyans, the Truffle people work toward the day they can oust the "monkeys" and
walk upon Planet Plant once more. 

   As a result of their hatred of Saiyans, they also have a dislike of
Half-breeds who appear very much the same as their pure blood relatives.

PERSONAE3
----------

   @RNote: In regards to personality, this is only a general guideline. We are
not forcing you to roleplay what is outlined here. @n

   As a mixture between Saiyans and Humans, @Chalf-breeds@n tend to fall somewhere
between the two personality wise. How much a half-breed leans towards a
particular sphere is usually dependant on which species genes are dominant. A
common trait amongst their kin is an almost overbearing need to earn their
parents approval. 

   Half-breeds have no official stance on other species and will usually adopt
a similar stance to either both or one of their parents. 

   Although mostly evil, a benevolent @CDemon@n is not unheard of. However most
have an angle that aims to improve their lot in life even if they are doing a
good deed for someone else. Power is the strongest currency amongst Demons,
especially those who reside in Hellfire City. Demons can take on the
embodiment of a sin and this will often shape their personality greatly as a
result. 

   Demons have an incensed hatred of the heavenly Kaios. Although not all
Demons come from being exiled Makaio, this is where the hatred first
originated. 

   @CKais@n have ascended to the top of the universal hierarchy, essentially
running it on behalf of the mysterious immortals and this instils a sense of
pride and honour amongst their kind. Most Kaios who earn roles in this
heirachy are often extremely pious individuals who are content to sit back and
watch the universe, carefully intervening where necessary, often indirectly. 
Most Kaios will never get the opportunity to take on a role like this however
so great honour is usually bestowed upon those who are appointed assistants to
the Grand Kaios and so forth. Although mostly good by nature, occasionally a
kaio is born of evil. These are branded as Makaio and if they cannot escape
authorities, will be exiled into hell. 

   Due to the relationship between the kaios, their fallen brethen and demons,
Kaios have a dislike for Demons and actively seek to keep their influence
minimal on the universe.

   @RNote: In regards to personality, this is only a general guideline. We are
not forcing you to roleplay what is outlined here. @n

   @CAndroids@n can have any number of personality traits which is largely
dependant on the race of the creater and the android's intent. Other factors
may affect this but generally speaking there is no way to broadly define
android personality types or specific enemies or friends. 

   @CBio-androids@n are similar to Androids in that it is impossible to broadly
define their personality types. They make take on an assumed personality
programmed into them by their creator but occasionally a portion of the DNA
that makes them up can become dominant even if not intended. Creators intent
and the DNA soup that make up a Bio-Android will ultimately define it's
personality. 

   @CKonatsus@n are a people drenched in a history of tradition. Their traditions
and ways have barely changed in over a thousand years and the same goes for
their technology. Although each village has their own culture and traditions,
generally speaking, Konatsu are polite, proud and very honourable. If a Konat
pledges himself unto you, he will continue to honour that pledge until the task
is completed, often even if it may end up with his death in the process. 
Although there have been female warriors amongst the Konatsu, many villages
still place heavy restrictions on their females and it can be quite a sexist
environment. Worship of a divine being known as Temujin is the pillar of the
only religion present on Konack and a majority of the population are of this
faith. 

   The only known enemy of the Konatsu people are Truffles for their
involvement in the civil war that threatened to destroy Konack centuries ago.

PERSONAE5
----------

   @RNote: In regards to personality, this is only a general guideline. We are
not forcing you to roleplay what is outlined here. @n

   @CKanassans@n can come in one of two varietys; A larger and more reptilian in
appearance sub-genus which is often more aggressive and fierce compared to the
more common, fish like sub-genus which tend to take on more mundane roles in
society and are more docile, friendly and intelligent compared to their larger
counter-parts. Kanassa is a world that has seen much fighting and has fueled a
largely military based society. Numerous attempts at colonising other worlds
have been met with failure on most fronts due to the powerful presence of the
Icer led World Trade Organisation. 

   Views other species with suspicion. However may consider aligning itself
with another species should they have similar goals to take down the Icers, of
which they currently lack the military strength to do so alone. 

   The only common personality trait amongst most @CMajins@n is immaturity and
child like behaviour. They will often be instilled with behaviour by the
sorcerer that creates them. Although very rare, it is rumoured majins may be
able to undergo a process where a small portion of the original Majin becomes
detached and unable to return to it's form which will then take on basic
instincts of it's own, before finding a host to ingest of which the personality
of the original majin and the host are combined. By nature, any creature
ingested by a majin will affect both their personality and their appearance.

PHASE
----------

   The Eldritch Star is a mysterious astral body that is only understood by the
Hoshijin and only partially understood by even them. They are naturally
attuned to the Star's strength on a universal scale. The Eldritch Star goes
through phases of strength each month. Each phase affects the Hoshijin
differently and they are the only ones who are affected by these phases. The
three phases will be listed and described below. 

   Birth Phase (1st-15th of every month): This phase increases; powerlevel, ki,
stamina, strength, and speed. It also vastly increases the rate at which
hoshijin regenerate while standing. 

   Life Phase (16th-22nd of every month): This phase increases; powerlevel, ki,
stamina, strength, and speed a great deal more. It also vastly increases the
rate at which hoshijin regenerate while standing. 

   Death Phase (23rd Onward): This phase gives Hoshijin no boosts. This is
their most vunerable phase.

PHOENIX-SLASH
----------

   Phoenix Slash is a technique where the user pours their charged ki into the
blade of a sword. This ki takes on the form of burning flames the engulf the
entire sword. They then draw the blade back and then bring it forward quickly
unleashing a phoenix shaped wave of flames at a target. It has the chance to
burn a target which makes healing wounds difficult for the target until the
burn heals.

PLANETS
----------

   Planets are large celestial bodies that orbit stars. In this particular
case they are important centers of interest to the game. There are multiple
planets, including planets that are off the transportation grid and reachable
only through private ship. A list of planets can be found below along with
whether the planet is important or backwater. There are asteroids, space
stations, and other astral bodies that can be visited but they will not be
listed here. Space in DBAT covers only a section of the North Galaxy. Let's
face it, galaxies are huge in real life. You wouldn't expect us to do all of
North Galaxy let alone South, East, and West along with it. Would you?

PLANT
----------

   Plant is a command used to put things objects into someone else's inventory.
Why would you do this? Well who knows, perhaps you stole something of theirs
and then made a forgery to replace it with. It will take them longer to know
what is up if they have a fake sitting benignly in their inventory. Also if
you wished to frame someone for whatever reason you could plant a controversial
thing on them. Be creative!

PLAYERS LOGON
----------

   The logon count is important for not only showing the number of people
logged on but also for determining rewards to be handed out. If someone logs
on and puts the logon count within 4 places of the highest logon record then 1
RPP will be handed out to everyone on (and each user account that logs on in
the next 24 hours). If the logon count matches the highest record then 2 RPP
is handed out. If it beats the record then 3 RPP is handed out. Each of these
rewards can only be obtained once per user account and the same reward will not
be passed out more than once per 24 hour period. 

   This is to encourage activity of current players and recruitment of new
players. So try to bring some friends in to share in the fun.

POCKET-DIMENSION
----------

   Pocket Dimension. Creating a pocket dimension is a tricky task. There is a
rumor though that rare prisms made by mysterious means hold the power to create
one for temporary use. The advantages of a pocket dimension are up to you to
find out. 

   Using a prism once will create the dimension and send you to it. Using it
twice will return you to the room you originally left. It is not advisable for
you to leave your belongings in a pocket dimension. They may be lost forever
as a result.

POISON
----------

   Poison is the technique of focusing one's ki and creating a toxic poison
with it. Then throwing that poison at a target in an attempt to poison them
obviously. The duration of the poison depends on the skill of the one
performing the technique. Poison will reduce the regen of PL/KI/ST to 1/4th
normal and deal an additional percentage of damage depending on the
constitution of the victim each regen tick (100 seconds. ) The table below
will illustrate the damage for each tick based on constitution. 

Conststitution      Current Powerlevel Loss
------------------------------------------------------------------------
100+       5% of Max PL
80+        7% of Max PL

30+        9% of Max PL
20+        10% of Max PL

POTENTIAL-RELEASE
----------

   Within most warriors is a hidden potential of strength that they are unaware
of and unable to grasp consciously. Those who are trained in potential release
can bring that out of a target. A target's potential can only be released once
period. The amount of their potential that gets released depends on the skill
of the one releasing the potential. Up to a maximum of 50% of the target's
base powerlevel. So if you are seeking to release, or have your potential
released, then find someone who has a high skill for best results.

POWERUP
----------

   Powering up is a way to increase your current powerlevel to its max by using
up ki. Usually your powerlevel heals itself over time from resting. However
sometimes you need to bring it up in a hurry and this command is the perfect
thing for that. Androids can not powerup. 

   Powering up will regen stamina by 2% for every powerup tick. Though this
will only happen if your ki happens to be at or above 50% of your max ki. 
Syntax: powerup

compared to another skill. PS cost rises when a skill level for a particular
skill gets higher as well.

-20% Weapon damage
-20% Throw damage

Weapon
-----------

PSYCHIC-BARRAGE BARRAGE
----------

   Psychic barrage is a technique where the user focuses their charged ki into
their brain. They close their eyes to visualize the attack and then open them
again while looking upon their target. They then fire ki charged psychic

PSYCHIC-BLAST PSYCHICBLAST BLAST
----------
   
@wPsychic Blast is a technique where the user takes their charged Ki and

along with negative thoughts at a target. No matter where the blast hits on
the target the thoughts will possess their brain during the moment of the
attack, showing them their worst fears in that instant. Its maximum power
rating isn't very high, but it has a high chance of forcing a target to lose
some of their charged ki from concentration loss.@n

PURGE
----------

Usage: purge [name]

   Purge destroys things. If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of
all mobiles and objects, but will not harm players. If the argument is an
object that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed. If the
argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory and
equipment lying on the ground. If the argument is the name of a player, the
player's inventory and equipment will drop on the ground and the player will
lose his/her connection. For this reason, PURGE should only be used on players
in disciplinary situations.

RADAR DRAGONRADAR SPACERADAR
----------

   There are two types of radar. Dragon radar used to find the locations of
dragonballs(if they are not currently stone and thus unable to be found) and
space radar used by private ships to detect the closest direction to a
particular planet(which helps in navigating the vastness of space). 

   How to go about obtaining a dragon radar, is a secret. If you know the
dragonball universe well you should know where to go looking for one. Ship
radar however is available with the purchase of a private ship. 
Dragon Radar
---
Syntax: detect

Space Radar (Used while seated in the pilot's chair)
   ---
Syntax: radar
        radar (planet)
        radar (buoy1 | buoy2 | buoy3)

   Note: You can only ping a destination in space every few seconds due to the
complex calculations involved. Also if you have autoexit set to normal you
will see a small radar map instead of directions in space.

5%   =  4 minutes
10%  =  2 minutes

REGENERATE
----------


   Regeneration is a unique ability to a few races. To those who have
regeneration death can be a rare thing to experience. That is if you have the
life force and ki to regenerate. Depending on your skill in regeneration you
will get more out of the LF and ki you use to regenerate. This will help you
spend less in the long run. For Majins and Bios regenerate has the chance to
save them from death if they are cut in half or lose their head. That is if
they have the ki. All regenerate races have the ability to regenerate their
limbs normally though. 
 
Races with Regenerate
-----------------------
   Majins can survive dying from an attack as long as they have 75% (50% for
Self D) of their LF left. All their LF will be used up and they will slowly
regenerate. During that pariod of time they can not be harmed and when fully
regenerated get their PL restored to their weighted max (LF is still drained to
0 though. )) Bio-Androids can survive dying from an attack as long as they
have 75% (50% for Self D) of their LF left. All their LF will be used up and
they will slowly regenerate. During that pariod of time they can not be harmed
and when fully regenerated get their PL restored to their weighted max (LF is
still drained to 0 though. ))

RELOAD
----------
Usage: reload < '*' | all | file >

Reload is used to reload text files such as the MOTD from disk into memory.
reload * reloads all the text files below.

Valid files are:

  background (/mud_dir/lib/text/background)
  credits    (/mud_dir/lib/text/credits)
  greetings  (/mud_dir/lib/text/greetings)
  handbook   (/mud_dir/lib/text/handbook)

  wizlist    (/mud_dir/lib/text/wizlist)
  xhelp      (/mud_dir/lib/text/help/*)
#1
REMOTE
----------
Usage: remote <variable> <id>

Remoting a variable saves that variable to the player file for future access. This is used heavily for quests to 
limit a player to only performing it once. Here is a quick example from zone 14. The variable must first be set 
and then saved to the players file via remote, like:
  * setting the variable to 1 means completed.
  set solved_example_quest_zone_14 1
  remote solved_example_quest_zone_14 %actor.id%
Then in future triggers it is checked if that variable already exists in the player file. In this example, if it 
does the player is not allowed to continue.
<variable> should always be a unique name. I suggest always including zone #.
<id> can be any value or text you wish to use later.

   Create a global variable belonging to a character or player whose id is specified. The variable must first 
exist in the script that is running.

For more examples go through the trigedit hallway.

8-9 Deaths: 90 MUD hours
10+ Deaths: 100 MUD hours

   Immortal: Immortals now have a 15% experience pentalty on all experience

without the fear of death your character gains less meaning out of activities
that award experience.

REWARDS RPP
----------

   Rewards are special 'rewards', go figure, that you can purchase with
Roleplay Points. Roleplay Points are earned mainly through roleplay logs that
you post on the MUD forum and that have been graded by a roleplay authorized
immortal(RAI). RAIs determines based on a set of criteria how much RPP a
player can be awarded per log. This can be found in the rules section of the
Roleplay Board located on the forum. 

   @CIf you are spotted RPing your character well you can receive as much as 2
RPP from a RAI. The definition of well being; 1: Follows the rules and 2:
Shows effort. You never know when you may be watched by an RAI. @n

To spend your RPP use the rpp command.

   The request rewards will not be handled instantly. You will need to wait on
an imm to deal with them. 

   The instant rewards will be handled... Instantly. The revival reward and
the experience rewards have their costs calculated automatically based on your
current level.

RIP
----------

   Rip is a command that allows you to try and rip the tail off of a victim. 
If the victim is awake slower than you and weak enough you will be able to pull
their tail off. If the target is the user of rip or asleep then the command
will succeed no matter what. 

   Tails grow back randomly over time so this is not a permanent solution to a
"tail" problem. 

Syntax: rip (target)

ROGAFUFUKEN
----------

   Rogafufuken, or Wolf Fang Fist, is a technique where the user takes their
charged ki and infuses their hands and feet with it. This both increases their
speed temporarily as well as strengthens the blows of their hand-strikes. 
This technique was invented and made famous by Yamcha. Most of the damage of
this attack is done by the ki that was charged, but the user's strength
increases the attack power considerably. 1 STR equals +1% damage. So a
strength of 15 would be +15% damage.

ROLEPLAY-LOG
----------

   Roleplay logs may be posted on the forum or given to other players. You may
only do this after the log in question is over 1 week old and things involving
the log are not going to effect things currently being roleplayed. Anything in
a log CAN NOT be used as IC info for anyone playing. If you are caught magicly
knowing things you shouldn't you are breaking IC and will be punished. 

   This is how you should make the log. Copy everything that happened
surrounding the log. Cut out prompt info(such as current pl) and anything that
would not be visible to either player at the same time. Basicly emotes, says,
combat messages, action messages, movement messages are ok. Score, status,
prompt, ooc channels, auction, etc. Are not ok. You must edit your own logs.
Logs that show great roleplaying will be rewarded by those involved in the
log(not just the one who made the log) receiving a higher roleplay ratings(seen
in whois and score). Those with higher roleplay ratings will be able to
request restricted races and be involved in immortal roleplay quests.

ROLL
----------

   Roll allows you to roll to your feet if you happen to be knocked off your
feet or happen to be sitting/resting. Its chances of happening per attack
sustained depend on your skill in it and whether you have enough stamina to

strength of the attacker and the agility of the roller.

ROUNDHOUSE
----------

   Roundhouse is a higher tier physical attack that is stronger than kick, with
a higher cooldown period, and using a good deal more stamina. It has a very
slim chance to destroy a target's limb if it connects. It also has a decent
chance to knock a target off their feet on a critical. 

Syntax: round (target)
#0
RPBANK
----------

   The RPbank, or roleplay bank, is where your roleplay points go between eras.
You can still use these points, just not for leveling or some of the items
listed on the rpp menu. You can also put points in the bank for certain things
in the store, however, you can't take the points out of it. 

Syntax: rpbank <amount>
#0
RUBYCHANNEL
----------

   Demons are capable of channeling lava from lava rooms into blood rubies. 
Charged blood rubies have two purposes. One is that they (while in your
inventory) aid flame related skills. The other purpose is that a charged blood
ruby that is thrown will do burn damage to what it hits. 

Syntax: channel

RULES
----------

   The rules of Dragonball Advent Truth are simple. They are categorized two
ways. Rules involving roleplay, and rules involving general mud behavior. 
The best rule to abide by though is by thinking first before every action "Will
this action benefit the overall experience of the MUD for everyone?" Being
honest about that question will help you go a long way.

RUNIC
----------

   Runic is a skill where the user write magical symbols (Runes) on the body of
a target. These symbols give an immediate and/or temporary effect to the
target. The Runic language is something that has been passed down for
generations on Zennith by whomever the current Runemaster happens to be. It is
said that in order to write runes you need to extract ink from a plant local to
Zennith. 

   Runes become available to write as you gain skill in Runic. Non-hoshijins
will suffer an additional cost of 2 ink per rune and hoshijins will have an +10
advantage when it comes to successfully writing a rune. 

   Hoshijin will be able to learn Runic from the Runemaster immediately while
non-hoshijin will have to complete a quest. The quest will require long space
travel to obtain. 
Cost -- Rune
-------------------------------------------
1 Ink - Kenaz: Grants infravision. Temporary.
2 Ink - Algiz: Grants Ethereal Armor (reduces damage received by 10%) Temporary.
3 Ink - Oagaz: When you are hit the aggressor (if a PC) suffers a 3 sec
cooldown. If they are a NPC then they permanently lose 2 speed. Temporary.
3 Ink - Laguz: Grants water breathing for a period of time.
4 Ink - Wunjo: Grants +15% EXP gains. Temporary.
4 Ink - Purisaz: Grants +10% damage to ki attacks. Temporary.
10 Ink - Gebo: Receive +125 PS.

Syntax: runic (target) (rune)

SAVE
----------
Usage: save

Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc. Your equipment is also saved in the 
(unlikely?) event of a crash.  The game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary 
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists, but you will lose experience, and all 
your objects stay in the game, with your corpse.

Note that the SAVE command only saves your equipment in the event of a crash.  If you are leaving the game 
normally, SAVE will NOT save your equipment -- you must find an Inn to store your belongings.

SAY TELL ASK WHISPER SHOUT YELL HOLLER '
----------

Usage: say | shout | holler <string>
       tell | whisper | ask <player> <string>

If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood better if you start your sentences with 
either say, tell, whisper or shout.

Examples:

  > say Hey, does anyone know how to get to Oz?
  > tell catje hi, how are you?

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in:

  > ' hello there.

Shout broadcasts your message to everyone is your geographic zone.  Holler broadcasts to everyone in the game 
but costs 20 movement points.  You must be level 2 before you can use shout and yell.

SCAN
----------

   This command shows what objects or people are in the surrounding rooms. Be
careful with this as sometimes it can output a lot of information that you will
have to sift through. In good light conditions you will be able to scan three
rooms out in every direction except inside, outside, down, and up.

SCATTER-SHOT SCATTERSHOT
----------
   
@wScatter Shot is a technique invented and made famous by Piccolo. The user
fires hundreds of Kiballs at a target. Instead of hitting the target directly
though they surround it from all sides preventing easy escape. They then all
close in at once. This attack has a very high chance of hitting and almost no
chance of missing if you are a master of it.@n
   
@wDepending on skill level, Scattershot has its cooldown reduced.@n
@wThe following bonus is only applicable to Piccolo's students.@n

SCOUTER
----------

   Scouters are used to detect the powerlevel of targets within their range. 
They can do this specificly which will yield more information, or they can do
this specifically where they scan an entire planet or area. Syntax: scouter
<target> (this yields information about a specific target in the same room as
you) Syntax: scouter scan (this will scan an entire planet for available
powerlevels)

   Scouters of lower quality explode when they directly scan a powerlevel too
high for them to read. Below scouter classes and the maximum powerlevel they
can read before exploding will be listed. 

Basic Scouter: 149,999
Mid Scouter: 4,999,999

SEISHOU-ENKO SEISHOUENKO ENKO
----------

@wSeishou Enko is a natural attack that Arlians possess. They are capable of
using it from the time they are small children. This attack is utilized by
charging their Ki and firing a beam of energy from their fleshy mouths. They
have an instinctual control over the technique which allows them to control the
Ki used for it to a high degree. Whenever Seishou Enko misses a target in any
way the amount of charged Ki used is divided by 4. This allows the Arlian to
preserve their charged Ki for more Seishou Enko uses.@n

SELFDESTRUCT
----------

   Self Destruction is a technique where the user focuses their charged ki,
available base powerlevel (converted to energy by this technique), and base
stamina (converted in much the same way). The user will flash as the technique
is prepared. When it is ready the user needs only use the command again and
they will explode. This will either focus all the damage on one victim if they
are grappling with them or on everyone else in the room. If it is not
concentrated on one target it will only do half damage. 

   You gain skill in self destruction every time you manage to pull it off. 
The gain is large and random. Due to the nature of the skill it isn't
something you will likely "train" often. Also the length of time to prepare a
self-destruction will vary depending on your skill with it. 

   @RSelfdestruct can be cancelled by retyping selfdestruct but only during the
preparation phase. @n

Syntax: selfdestruct
#0
SELL
----------

Usage: sell [#] <item>
       sell <#>.<item>

   If you'd like to sell an item to a shopkeeper, trying selling it to them. 
Most shops specialize in what they will buy, so you may have to look around to
find a buyer for your items. 
 
Examples:
 
  > sell sword       (sell the first sword in your inventory)
  > sell 3 sword     (sell the first three swords in your inventory)

SENSEI
----------

   Sensei are teachers. More specifically they are the main trainer that your
character learns from. There are trainers who anyone can learn from, and
trainers who are extended branches of a Sensei's school. However Sensei are
only the trainer that was chosen during character creation. Depending on your
sensei you may have trainers available to your character others may not have,
or lack trainers others have. This adds complexity and strategy to what sensei
you choose. Not all sensei paths are equal, but all have their upsides and
downsides.

SET
----------
Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of characters, both players and 
mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE on a player who IS logged on, your 
change will be lost.  If you wish to set a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with 
the FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

The following are valid fields:

commands associated with it before you get going.

Look out window : Use this command when you are in the same room as the
cockpit window. This allows you to see outside the ship.

SHOGEKIHA
----------
   
@wShogekiha is a technique where the user fires an invisible blast of Ki at a
target. This attack is usually quite surprising to enemies. However its main
advantage is the ability to destroy an attack that is pursuing the user or
someone else. Giving it a defensive edge as well as standard offensive use. 
   
Shogekiha also has a chance to eliminate 25% of a victim's charged Ki.@n

   Shops come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and dealing in different
categories of objects. While most shops will purchase goods similar to what
they sell (example: buying armor because they also sell armor) the shops to
sell goods at are identified by the "Pawn" moniker. Pawn shops will purchase a
wide variety of item types from players, and some even offer better than usual
prices for items sold to them. Equipment shops tend to focus entirely on
selling either a loose collection of equipment or an entire themed set of
equipment. Food shops sell food and sometimes drink items, and usually these
items are better than what can be found outside of a shop. Supply/tool/misc.
Shops tend to sell tools and other items with specific uses. Basically a
player should try to understand the shops they visit and which ones are suited
for the player's current needs. Not all shop types or their specific nuances
have been documented in this file, as they are far too numerous to ever do so.

SHUTDOWN
----------


Usage: shutdown [reboot | die | pause]

   SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down. The SHUTDOWN command works in conjunction with
CircleMUD's 'autorun' script. If you are not using autorun, the arguments are
meaningless. If you are using autorun, the following arguments are available:


REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to restart the MUD.

DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is explicitly run again.

PAUSE      Create a file called 'paused' in Circle's root directory; do not try to restart the MUD until 
'paused' is removed.

SKILL-SLOTS
----------

   @nSkill slots determine how many skills you can learn. The base amount of
skill slots is 30 but this amount can be increased via traits or selecting a
@Rsage@n class Sensei, for example @RKibito@n. The base value may also be affected by
race choice (see @Rhelp racial bonuses@n), either positively or negatively. 

   The following groups of skill slots will only take ONE skill slot when you
have learned at least a little bit of all of them. (@CGroup 1@w: Punch, Kick,
Elbow, and Knee) (@CGroup 2@w: Kiball, Kiblast, Beam, Shogekiha, and Renzokou
Energy Dan)

   Racial skills (such as Majin's injest) do @RNOT@n count towards your skill slots.

SKILLS
----------

   Skills is a command that lists the skills you know. These have their own
level and depending on that level will rate their chances of success and how
strong their effects are. Skills can be trained through use once they have
been learned, or through practicing them at an official trainer. As PS is hard
to come by it is more efficient to train through use than to spend PS. PS
should be saved as much as possible for learning new skills. 

   You can limit what the command skills shows you by using it with an
argument. Such as a number to limit skills to showing you the skills you have
that have a level of that number or greater, or a string of letters to show
 skills that have those letters in their name.

SLAM
----------

   Slam is the highest level of upper body physical attack. The user either
slams the target with their fists or grabs them (during a critical) and flings
them into the ground. It does a lot more damage than roundhouse, and has a
high cooldown period, uses a lot of stamina. On a critical it has a very high
chance of knocking the victim out for a period of time. It also has a slim
chance to destroy a limb if it hits one. 

Syntax: slam (target)

SLEIGHT-OF-HAND
----------

   Sleight of Hand is used by the command steal and by the command plant. It
increases the user's chances of not being caught rummaging through other
character's belongings. 

   Player vs player theft is now logged for imm review as well as informing the
victim when they check their inventory that they have been recently robbed. 
This warning will only appear the first time you check inventory after being
stolen from, but will be extremely hard to miss at the top of the inventory

SMOTE
----------

   Smote is a type of emote that is more free-form, allowing the user to write
more complex messages of their character's actions. Smote requires you to
include # in place of your name somewhere in it. Otherwise an OOC tag with
your username will be placed above the smote for OTHERS to see. Smote should
not be abused, it is not for writing actions that are impossible or for
deceiving other players into thinking it is a game message. Abuse of smote
will be punished under the breaking of character rule. 

   You can put in special colored speech in emotes with &1 and &2. For example
you get the output in an smote of '@CBlah Blah@w'@n if you enter &1Blah Blah&2 in an
smote. You can place a * followed immediately by a name to have another
character's name placed (view dependent also) into the emote. The name must be
immediately after the asterisk and its first letter must be capitalized. 
(Example: *Carl). You can only target one other character in an emote at a
time.

SNEAKING
----------

   Sneaking allows you to attempt to move from one room to another without
alerting anyone that you have passed through. It won't make you hidden if they
stop to look at a room you are in, but it will make it harder for them to
notice you passing through. Move silently and balance are the skills that help
you sneak better. Listen is the skill that others rely on to detect your
sneaking into or out of a room.

SNET
----------

   SNET or Scouter Net is a set universal radio frequencies that all scouters
are tapped into. The default frequency is channel 1, and the channels go all
the way up to 999. People on a frequency can only communicate with others on
that frequency. 

   Syntax: snet <1-999> (snet and a number of 1-999 by its self will change
your scouter's snet frequency. )

   Syntax: snet <message> (this will display a message for all those listening
to the frequency your scouter is on)

   Syntax: snet <* message> (This will display a message across all channels at
the same time, though it will not allow you to listen to all channels yourself.

Syntax: snet check
Syntax: snet #(number) (message)

SNOOP
----------

Usage: snoop [player]

   Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'. 

   Obviously, there are many ethical considerations to the use of this command;
snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary purposes. 

Type snoop <your name> or just snoop to stop snooping.
#1
SOCIALS
----------

Usage: <social> [<victim>]

   Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others. The
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages. Generally, social
commands are used only to express emotion and not to take action, but it is
possible that some mobs (or players) will take action based on the social. 
(Slap a dragon lately? )

Example:

  > shake homer
  > applaud marge
  > stare

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available socials.

SOFTCAPPING
----------

   Softcap is a term referring to the point where exercising at a particular
level yields only boosts of +1. This is called a softcap because it isn't a
true cap(as you can still gain) but it does make continuing at that level much
much less effective. Softcapping is in simple terms a balance mechanic due to
the nature of gains on levels. The exact formula for when a softcap occurs is
not going to be shared here.

SOLAR-FLARE
----------

   Solar Flare is a technique where the user places hands at the either side of
their head and with a light source to their back(preferably a sun) they use
their ki to magnify the light many times. This can blind anyone who doesn't
have their eyes closed. The blinding is temporary but can be just long enough
to serve a purpose for the user. To close your eyes to prevent blindness, you
must type closeeyes. However with your eyes closed you can't see anything the
same as if you were blinded. To open them again just repeat the command.

SPARRING
----------

   Sparring is a type of training where you fight an opponent but your attacks
stop short of killing them. You will knock them out instead. This is useful
for physical training but more importantly for training one's attacks in a safe
way. Realize though that the further the difference in level between sparring 
opponents the lower the gains will be (up to not getting gains at all.)

If you want to try sparring with an NPC, say anything with the word "spar" in
it, then activate sparring with the "spar" command.

Spar gains are derived based mostly on your current character level "bracket".
Up to a hard cap where the amount of experience earned from sparring no longer

SPECIAL-BEAM-CANNON SBC
----------

   Special Beam Cannon is a technique invented by Piccolo and made famous by
him. The user places their index and middle fingers against their forehead. 
They then pool their charged ki there before firing a spiraling beam of energy

SPIRAL COMET SPIRAL-COMET
----------

   Spiral Comet is a technique perfected by Jeice and Burter. It is usually a
two person attack that uses great speed to rain ki blasts down on a target. 
Ginyu has taken the skill and altered it slightly for his students to use it as
a solo skill though. The user begins moving incredibly fast in a spot above
their target creating a vortex. They launch a large first strike blast once
the vortex is formed which will consume up to 50% of their total ki. They will
continue firing attacks afterward. These attacks will worth 5% of the user's
ki. Since this attack is sustained for such a long duration the user is
capable of putting 100% charged ki into it. While the technique is in use the
user is unable to be hit by physical attack or ki attacks that are below Tier
4. The only exception is if the ki attack is also an Area of Effect attack.

SPIRITBALL

   Spirit ball is a technique invented and made famous by Yamcha. The user
forms a ball of energy above their palm and send it after a target. If it
happens to miss the target or is dodged the spirit ball can be sent after the
target again and again until it is dealt with. It is weaker than other attacks
of its tier level but makes up for this by its chances to hit a target.

SPIRITCONTROL SPIRIT-CONTROL
----------

   This self buff lasts forbetween 2 and 5 mud hours, and while it is in effect
the user can instantlycharge ki to the desired percent. However the user will
be charged from their current ki 5% of max ki everytime they charge to a
percent (1% if you have Spirit Control's skill level at 100). Using spirit
control costs 20% of your max ki taken from stamina. This is only taken when
you first put the buff on and will not be charged again as long as it lasts
afterward. Further there is a 15% chance to fail to charge while the buff is
in effect, this will not cost you anything but will remove the buff. This
failure rate is reduced by 1% (down to a minimum of 5% failure) for every 10
skill levels you have in Spirit Control. Spirit Control acts as a tier 1 in
regards to skill prerequisites.

STATE-OF-THE-UNIVERSE
----------

   A fragile peace reigns supreme over the known galaxy, only briefly broken as
the World Trade Organisation seeks to expand it's holdings. But make no
mistake, this peace, so fragile that it is, will be broken. 

   Even now, the machinations of war are afoot. Plans are being drawn up,
weapons stockpiled and soldiers train rigorously. When the fragile peace
shatters, it shall shatter with the sound of a thousand symphonies. When the
fragile peace breaks, the flames of war shall scorch every corner of the galaxy
before they are extinguished. 
   The saiyans, barbaric and warlike as they are, will wash out into the
galaxy, seeking worthy fights to prove their strength, uncaring of the
consequences. 

   The gaze of the World Trade Organisation has fallen on Earth, knowing that the planet home to the Humans has 
become a glittering jewel in the galaxy.

   But the humans are not without their own ambitions, many believe themselves
capable of imposing an order and peace on the universe that will herald a new
age. 

   The hidden remnants of the Truffles plan their revenge on the Saiyans, who
conquered their home world planet Plant. When the time is right, every saiyan
will pay their debt to the Truffles with their blood. 

   The Kanassans, a mixture of reptilian and fish-like humanoids, have had
numerous clashes with other galactic powers before. Most recently, the World
Trade organisation. Kanassa, their home world, has been scarred to the point
where it can barely support their current population, so the Kanassans have
been seeking to colonize other worlds for some time, with mixed success. 

   Even the serene world Aether, home to the Kaios is not saved from conflict.
The birthrate of the Makai has increased greatly in recent times, this swelling
of numbers has made it nigh impossible for them to be exiled. The exact state
of this conflict is unbeknownst, even to the citizens of Haven but the Makai
have taken over half of the Kaiju forest, where they and their brethren are
born from the Kaiju fruit. The stark reality is that the Kai may soon be
overwhelmed by their dark brethren.

STATUS
----------
   The status command is used to display information about the status of your
character. This displays mostly text messages, so unlike score you will not
get statistical data. Instead status covers mostly the conditions of your
character. How hungry or thirsty they are, what position they are in, what is
influencing them, whether they are transformed, their physical appearance, etc.


Syntax: status

STEAL
----------

Usage: steal <item> <victim>

   Use steal to take zenni or items from people. The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced sleight of hand, the victim's
spot skill, your speed vs the victims, whether they are
sleeping/resting/sitting, and lastly a bit of luck. 
Examples:

   Player vs player theft is now logged for imm review as well as informing the
victim when they check their inventory that they have been recently robbed. 
This warning will only appear the first time you check inventory after being
stolen from, but will be extremely hard to miss at the top of the inventory
list. 

  > steal zenni drunk
  > steal sword mercenary
    (If it's wielded, only possible if he is sleeping)

STONE-SPIT
----------

   Stone spit is a technique that allows its user to turn a target to stone. 
The original inventor of this technique is Dabura. He could make a victim turn
to stone permanently unless he was killed or released them himself. Anyone
else who learns this will not be able to do that though as they can only turn a
victim to stone for a short period of time. 

Syntax: spit (target)
#0
STOP
----------

   Stop allows you to stop your fighting stance. This will not prevent whoever
is fighting you from starting the fight again or continuing it. The best use
for this is when you want to stop sparring with someone, stop sparring and then
use stop to leave your combat readiness. 

Syntax: stop
#0
STRING
----------
Usage: string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters.  The format is:

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.

Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):

Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at.  For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter a string mode, and the game will 
prompt you for new lines to the string until you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with 
a '@@'.

Mobiles and objects currently cannot be strung.

SUPPRESS
----------

   This help file is unfinished. Suppress is used to suppress your current pl
to a certain percentage of your max. This could be helpful for hiding your
true strength as well as your presence. It also can be used to fight with
weaker opponents on a more even playing field. Suppressed powerlevel will take
damage in the place of your current powerlevel, so if you take damage you won't
be able to regain that lost powerlevel by no longer suppressing.

SWIM
----------

   Swimming is one way of travelling in DBAT. It takes stamina per tile move,
as well as stamina per rest ticker whilst swimming in the room (not flying). 

   Your stamina cost for swimming is directly related to how much weight you
have in your inventory, worn items included. If you find yourself stuck
between a sensei area and land low level, dropping everything you own and
coming back for them shortly later is usually a good idea. 

Or pray to the gods that they heal you in time!

TEXT-EDITOR TEXTEDITOR /d /i /h /s /a /c /ra /l /fi WORDWRAP WORD-WRAP FORMATTING /e#
----------

   The text editor is what you use to write room/mob/obj/extra descriptions,
mudmails, and even boards. It allows you more commands than the typical entry.
To learn the commands while using the text editor, type /h. It will tell you
what all the commands do. Always use /fi to format, indent, and word wrap.
It looks much better to see writing that is formatted than one that runs all
over the place wrapping around etc. Just simply type /fi on a new line and hit
enter. Before you save type /l to list the buffer and see for yourself how it
looks. Fix as needed.
   When entering the text editor for the first time make sure to use /c to clear
the current contents. Indent and format all descriptions by typing /fi (format
with indent) in the text editor.  This includes all forms of OLC, mudmails,
boards, and anywhere else you use the text editor. This will indent the line
by 3 spaces and wrap your text at less than 80 characters so telnet users can
read it.
 
Editor command formats: /<letter>
 
@n/a         -  aborts editor
@n/c         -  clears buffer
@n/d#        -  deletes a line #
@n/e# <text> -  changes the line at # with <text>
@n/f         -  formats text. 
@n/fi        -  indented formatting of text (highly recommended for all desc's)
/fi#       -  indented formatting on a specific line
/fi #-#    -  indented formatting on specific lines
@n/h         -  list text editor commands
@n/i# <text> -  inserts <text> before line #
@n/l         -  lists buffer
@n/n         -  lists buffer with line numbers
@n/r 'a' 'b' -  replace 1st occurance of text <a> in buffer with text
@n/ra 'a' 'b'-  replace all occurances of text <a> within buffer with text
        usage: /ra 'pattern' 'replacement'
@n/s         -  saves text

NOTE: /f and /fi in trigedit will autoindent your trigger.
Commands such as /r, /n, /e#, /i#, /d# are invaluable and will make your job
much easier. For example lets say you mistype "the" with "teh" in a 10 line
description. Instead of /c (clearing) the text you can /r 'teh' 'the' or if it
was on line 5 you can type /e5 <line with teh spelled correctly> or /d5. Learn
all these options.

THROW
----------
   
@wThrow is a skill used for... Throwing. Throwing something at someone else
can hurt them in quite a unique way. The weight of the character/object
thrown, the skill in throwing, and the user's strength determine the damage
done. In addition, those with the throw skill will be able to throw additional
stacked items depending on their speed skill. Items that are not a throwing
type of weapon will be less effective as a thrown weapon.
   
As an addition, those under Tapion, Kurzak, Ginyu, and Dabura will start
with throw at a moderate skill level, and throw has a large bonus to multithrow
if you are not currently wielding a weapon.@n

Non-throwing items will not multi-throw, and will deal 55% less damage to begin with.

Usage: time

   Gives you the current game time. Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it. You'll have
to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this particular
notion of time; the opening Hours of the shops, for example.

TLIST TRIGLIST TRIG-LIST TRIGEDIT-LIST 
----------

Usage: tlist <range of vnums or zone number>

Tlist gives you a list of the triggers numbered within the parameters.
Be warned that all the triggers on TBA may not work since anyone could
have made them. Ask around for the best examples. Zone 13, 40, 41 is a 
good start.

   tlist 13          - lists all triggers defined in zone 13

TRAINING
----------

   Train is a command that has several branches to it. This command allows you
to train one of the six cardinal statistics to your character. Those being
strength, constitution, intelligence, speed, agility, and wisdom. The gravity
of the room you are in as well as the amount of weight you are wearing (not
carrying, but wearing) determines how quickly you can increase one of those
stats. Each stat has a limit it much reach before it increases. That limit is
5,000 + 500 for every point of the stat. When the limit is reached the number
is reset for you to try and increase the stat again (with any change from your
last train carried over with the reset). 

   Special Weighted equipment can be found on Vegeta. This will greatly
increase the benefits of training along with any other heavy equipment/weapons
you may happen to find. 

   You must be wearing a sufficient amount of weight to train at all. The
amount is 110x your level for levels twenty to levels 46. After 47, its 125x
for all levels above. 

   Those who have a level above 80 get a large bonus to each train they
perform. Those who have a level above 60 get a small bonus to each train they
perform. 

King Kai's planet gives a 15% boost to training stats.

   You can now use train at a sensei and get a significant boost to your
training rate. This costs 8 zenni and 1 ps per train at a sensei. If you do
not have enough then nothing is deducted

TRANSFORMATIONS
----------

   @n Transforming is a trait that almost every race in DBAT shares. Their
transformations are all unique however. They all differ on strength, and what
is required to earn the transformation. Some also differ on whether they use
up stamina while transformed and how fast stamina is used up by each individual
transformation they happen to have. For example Super Saiyan Third uses up
more stamina than Super Saiyan Fourth. Super Saiyan Fourth uses up more
stamina than Super Saiyan Second. It depends on the power of the
transformation and the race that has it. 

   Some races do not have very good transformations compared to others. 
Transformations are not the only qualifier for strength when it comes to a
race. Transformations have been balanced on DBAT so don't expect the status
quo of transformations in DBZ. That wouldn't make for very fun gameplay.

TRIBEAM
----------
   
@wTribeam is a technique that was most famously used by Tien. The user forms
a triangle with their hands and aims at a target with the gap between the
hands. A sudden blast of powerful charged Ki is fired from the gap between the
hands and slams into the opponent. This attack is has the advantage of hitting
the target with a small cooldown period after it hits. After charging beyond
the minimum level of Ki, the user will begin to put their own life energy into
the attack, greatly increasing the amount of damage it does at the potential
cost of the user's life.@n
   
@wTribeam is a combinable attack.@n

Tribute
----------
   Tribute is a perk of being in the World Trade Organization. For every world they own, once a fortnight, they 
receive an amount of zenni into the clan bank to reflect this.

How the tribute money is used, is up to those with the power to access it.

TRIG-ATTACH
----------

Usage: attach vnum id
* This small trigger will attach a trigger to the carrier this can for instance 
* be used if you want the mob to change attitude by adding another trigger 
* (ie - mob was mad - mob got apple - mob gets a 'nicer' trigger attached
attach 3001 %self.id% 

   This command allows a script to attach a trigger (referenced by vnum) to 
anything capable of receiving triggers, by id number. (%self.id%, %object.id%, 
and %actor.id% are examples of id numbers, for use with this command.)

See Also: ATTACH, DETACH, TRIG-DETACH
#1
TRIG-DETACH
----------

Usage: detach <vnum | all> id
* if we - as described in the attach example, want our mob/obj/room to behave
* differently, it's not always enough to just add another trigger with attach.
* it might be necessary to remove some old ones :
detach 3000 %self.id%
or
detach all %self.id%

   The opposite of attach, this removes triggers from the specified target.

Example: @RTSTAT 45@n

See Also: ATTACH, DETACH, TRIG-ATTACH
#1
TRIG-RETURN
----------
 
Usage: return 0
 
   Return sets the return value of the trigger. Normally, a script will return
1, unless return 0 is specified. Unlike most computer languages, the return  
command does not end the trigger's execution. The value is returned after all 
the commands have been executed, or a wait or halt command is called. 

Example: @RTSTAT 1364@n

See Also: HALT, WAIT
#1
TRIG-SET
----------

Usage: set <variable> <value>

Set sets variable to value, without evaluating it. 
 Example: set foobar 15 - 5
 sets the variable foobar to the string "15 - 5"

* this example sets the value of result to '%self.hitp% * 100 %self.maxhitp%'
set result %self.hitp% * 100 %self.maxhitp% 
* The %result% var now works as a 'function' every time it's accessed.
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
%damage% %self% 30
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%

   The set command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to 
the provided expression, which will be evaluated when the variable is accessed. 
There also exists an "eval" command, with the same syntax. Eval differs in that 
the expression is evaluated immediately.

See Also: EVAL
#1
TRIG-SWITCH TRIGEDIT-SWITCH CASE DEFAULT BREAK
----------

Usage: switch expression
    
switch %random.4%
  case 1
    emote sings a merry song about someone named Fulbert and Beatrice.
  break
  case 2
    emote booms out loudly, 'Heigh Ho! Heigh Ho! It's home from work we go!'
  break
  case 3
    emote tries to sing falsetto, but his voice doesn't agree.
  break
  default
    sing
  break
done

   Switch evaluates an expression and looks for a match amongst the case 
statements that follow. If none of the following case statements are a match, 
and a default statement exists, the default statement is considered a match. 
If a match is found, the commands that follow it, up until a break or done 
command, are executed. 
Break is used to terminate commands in a switch. 
Case is used to begin a new conditional group in a switch block.
Default is similiar to case but matches any condition not met. 
Done is used to terminate a while or switch block.

@RWARNING: long and verbose (wordy)@n

To add life to the worlds circlemud uses something called scripts (or triggers). 
There are three major types of game objects which can use scripts. These are 
mobiles (mobs), objects, and rooms (world objects). Examples of scripts in the 
game are: 

Cityguards screaming 'PROTECT THE INNOCENT! BANZAI! CHARGE!', (a mob script).
A portal that teleports players when they enter it (an object script).
A room that creates a new exit when a player pulls a lever (a room script).

Each game item (room, mobile, or object) can have a script. A script is composed
of one or more triggers, which work in collaboration to define complex actions 
of the game object. A trigger is a definition of an event that the script watches 
for, and list of commands to execute when that event occurs. 

There are several different types of triggers. Each trigger type determines
when the trigger will be checked. For example, a mob speech trigger is checked
every time a character who is in the same room as the mob with the trigger uses
the 'say' command. A room enter trigger is checked every time a character
enters the room. There are two parts of the trigger used to determine if the
trigger's commands are executed when it is checked, the argument and numerical
argument (NArg). Some triggers use both; some may use only one of the two; and
some may use neither. The interpretation of these two fields is dependant on
the type, and is described in more detail on the webpage and in the help files.

When an event in the game occurs, each script in the room where the event 
occurred is checked to see if there are any triggers which are supposed to
react to that event. A trigger currently running (such as from a 'wait'
command) is skipped. Only one trigger of each script will be run by a single
event. For example, if there are two triggers on a script, and both are the
same type with the same arguments, the second trigger will only be run if the
first one is already running. 

Triggers can be of more than one type. For example, to simulate a cursed item,
a trigger on the object could be of types drop, give, and remove. A more common
combined trigger would have both random and global types, so the random trigger
would be checked even when the zone was empty. Combined triggers must have the
same argument and numerical argument. 

The other component of a trigger is the command list. This is a series of
commands that are executed when the trigger is run. Commands are chosen from
two groups of commands, script specific commands and game commands. Script
specific commands are those commands that only the script interpreter can
recognize. These include flow control commands (such as if, elseif, else, end,
halt, wait, and return), and commands to manipulate variables (such as set,
eval, unset, and global). Game commands are those commands that a player could
issue from their command line as well as special commands added for mobiles,
objects, and rooms.

TRIGEDIT-ADVANCED-TUTORIAL
----------

This section is a step by step tutorial to explain the writing of scripts 
(triggers). It goes through the script creation process developing a practical
script. 

Decide what you want the script to do. 
   Consider how your mob, item, or room should behave. Doing this before
worrying what can be done prevents you from limiting yourself to what you have
seen other scripts do, and allows you to produce a more interesting script. 
  
For example, I want to create a gate guard for a small walled town. The ruler
of the town has decided that each group of people will be charged ten coins to
enter his domain. The gate guard must notify travelers of the cost to enter,
collect the money, allow people who have payed to enter the city, and close the
gate after them. This will be a mob script. 
  
Decide what trigger types you need.
   Look through the section on triggers to see the currently available trigger
types. New trigger types can be added by one of the implementors if needed. All
types are listed in the help files @RHELP TRIGEDIT-TYPE@n.
  
Our gate guard needs to react to five different events: 

1. A character entering the room from the south, the road leading away from the
   town, needs to be informed of the price for entrance. This will be a greet
   trigger. 
2. When the guard is given ten or more coins, the guard must open the gate. This
   is done by a bribe trigger. 
3. If the guard is given less than ten coins, the guard needs to inform the
   character that it is insufficient. This is also a bribe trigger. 
4. When someone passes through the gate into the city, the guard must close the
   gate behind them. This is done with an act trigger. 
5. When the gate is opened from the other side, the guard must eventually close
   it. This will be another act trigger. 

Determine the argument and the numerical argument of the triggers. Read the 
specifications on trigger types, and decide what the values for argument and 
Numeric Arg must be for the trigger to react appropriately to the events.
  
@RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-GREET@n
Argument    : not used 
Numeric Arg : the percent chance that the trigger is run when checked. Since I 
              want it run every time someone enters the room, it should be 100. 

@RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-BRIBE@n
Argument    : not used
Numeric Arg . minimum number of gold pieces required to activate this trigger.
              The guard should only open the gate when given 10 coins, so it
              should be 10. 

For the second bribe trigger, the guard must respond whenever someone gives 
him 1 or more coins, so Numeric Arg should be 1. 

@RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-ACT@n
Argument    : the text the mob should react to. Since I want the guard to 
              react to a character going north, argument should be "leaves 
              north." 
Numeric Arg : Since argument is a phrase, NArg should be 0. 

The second act trigger should trigger on text "The gate is opened from the other
side", so it is triggered whenever someone opens the gate from inside the town.
Again, Numeric Arg should be 0 for a phrase. 
  
Write the list of commands for the trigger.
This is the most complex and time consuming part of a trigger to write. The
valid commands are explained in the help files and on the webpage. Variables 
and expressions are also used in the commands list.

For the greet trigger, I want the guard to inform anyone entering from the
south how to get into the city. First, I must check if the character is
entering from the south. If they are entering from that direction, the guard
should tell the character the cost of entry. The command list for this trigger
will be as follows: 
  
if (%direction% == south) 
 wait 1 sec
 emote snaps to attention as you approach. 
 wait 1 sec
 say Admittance to the city is 10 coins. 
end 
 
Checking the specifications of the greet trigger, we see that the variable
"direction" is set to the direction that the character entered. The percent
sign surrounding direction means it is a variable. The two equal signs together
compare the value of the variable to the word "south". If these are equal, the
statements between this line and the line "end" will be executed. The "wait 1 sec"
pauses briefly while the character finishes his move. (The greet trigger is
actually checked before the character enters the room, so if we did not have
this line, he or she would never see the guard snap to attention.) After
another brief pause, the guard announces the cost to enter the town. The
indentations are not needed, but make it easier to read. 

The guard must open the gate if ten or more coins were given to him. The
command list looks like this: 
  
wait 1 sec
unlock gate 
open gate 
wait 10 sec 
close gate 
lock gate 
  
After a brief wait (so everything doesn't happen at once), the guard unlocks
the gate and opens it. The guard will close the gate after 10 seconds, even if
no one passes through it. 

The guard must inform the character that his payment was not enough, and
return the money. The commands list will be: 
  
wait 1 sec
say This is not enough! 
give %amount% coins %actor.name% 
  
For the line "give %amount% coins %actor.name%", the variables amount and actor,
both set when the bribe trigger is called, are substituted into the line before
the guard performs the command. The gate guard returns the number of coins he
was given. 

For the first act trigger, I want the guard to close and lock the gate after
someone passes through the gate. The guard should wait briefly so he isn't
shutting the gate on the character's back, and close and lock the gate. The
command list will be: 

wait 1 sec
close gate 
lock gate 
  
For the last act trigger we want the guard to close and lock the gate when it 
is opened from the other side. The commands will look like: 
  
wait 5 sec 
close gate 
lock gate 
  
The "wait 5 sec" gives time for someone on the other side to get through the gate. 
Decide the order of the triggers. The triggers are checked from first to last.
If there are two triggers of the same type, the first one run will be the only
one run. 

There are two sets of triggers which are the same type, the bribe triggers and
the act triggers. If the bribe trigger with the Numeric Arg of 1 is first, the 
other trigger would never be run, since ten or more coins is still one or more. 
In order for my triggers to work right, the trigger with Numeric Arg of 10 must 
be before the trigger with the NArg of 1 in the list. The other possible 
conflict is with the act triggers. Since both have arguments that will not 
occur together, the order does not matter. 

Create the trigger file.
Simply use trigedit to create your triggers and they will be saved for you
when you exit the editor. 

Put the triggers into the game.
In the OasisOLC medit redit oedit menus, use menu option S to enter the
script editor. Then select the triggers that will be part of your script. Note,
that order is important! If there are two possible triggers that could both be
executed at the same time, only the first one found in the list will be
activated. In this example, it means place the bribe trigger for 10 or more
coins BEFORE the bribe trigger for 1 coin. 

Test the script.
You should see how the script actually works in the game, and watch other
people interact with it. Often you will see ways you can improve it. 

@RGOTO 1310@n and work your way north to test these out. Triggers 4-8.

TRIGEDIT-MOB-ACTION ACTIONS
----------

Activated when a matching action is performed by a character in the room. 
Actions are any text output via the act() function, and include most output 
from the mud. (Notable exclusions are character say's, and immortal echo's.)

Mob trigger tutorial
This mini-quest is setup in TBA as an example. @RGOTO 1310@n and work your way north
with nohassle off.
 
The following 7 steps should give you a general idea about what to do, and how to go 
about making small quests in the dg scripting language. This example is concentrated 
on quests involving mobs. 

The process can be broken down to the following:  
   1. Decide what you want the script to do.
   2. Make corresponding objects and mobs.
   3. Split up the quest.
   4. Find corresponding trigger types.
   5. write the scripts for the triggers.
   6. Attach the scripts - permanently
   7. Done ? 
   
1. Decide what you want the script to do.  
   In this example, we want to make a small mini quest in an area. The quest 
will work like this: When you enter the room, where the first mob is, it will 
start to tell a tale. In this tale, you are instructed to perform a task, in 
this case, kill an evil ogre, that lives in a nearby forest. As proof of the 
kill, you must bring back the ogre's apprehension to the questgiving mob. 

2. Make corresponding objects and mobs.  
   Ingredients for this quest:
      1 Questgiver mob - I've chosen 'the questmaster' - vnum 1310
      1 Target mob - In this case 'an apprehensive Ogre' - vnum 1311
      1 Quest object - 'some apprehension' - trash object, vnum 1300 

3. Split up the quest.  
   Next thing to do is look at the different steps involved with the quest. In 
this example, we have three steps: 
   Player entering room -> tell story 
   Player finds ogre -> load object (Do not just want the mob to carry it) 
   Player gives questmaster apprehension -> reward player 

4. Find corresponding trigger types.  
   Having split the quest up also means we reasonably easy can decide what 
kinds of triggers we need - in this case: 
   mob GREET trigger (attached to questmaster) 
   mob DEATH trigger (attached to ogre) 
   mob RECEIVE trigger (attached to questmaster) 
 
5. write the scripts for the triggers.  
    Up to this point, neither trigedit or the script editors have been used. 
All the info needed is in the help files and on the webpages. Notice most of
the work required is PLANNING! You must know exactly what you want to do before
you do it. Now is the time to fire up trigedit and start editing the triggers. 
Let's give the first one vnum 0, and edit it to look like the script below: 


> trigedit 0
Trigger Editor [0]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example 1310 - Quest Offer@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yGreet @n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@c* we don't want him to tell this to mobs. vnum -1 is reserved for players.
if %actor.vnum% == -1
  * only greet players coming from the south.
  if %direction% == south
    *wait 1 second, always give the player time before you start sending text.
    wait 1 sec
    say Can you help me, %actor.name%?
    wait 1 sec
    say An apprehensive ogre has something of mine.
    wait 1 sec
    say If you slay him I'll give you all the coins I can spare.
    wait 1 sec
    say Please, bring me the apprehension he has stolen.
  end
end@n

The script above will be executed every time anyone enters the room. If the 
person entering is a mobile, the if check at the beginning will stop the 
execution. Note, that I've named the trigger as I did above. ALWAYS include
the VNUM of where you plan on attaching the trigger. Also, give it a name so 
it is easy to see what part of the quest this trigger handles. The second 
script is very simple.

> trigedit 1
Trigger Editor [1]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example 1311 - Kill ogre@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yDeath@n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@csay you got the best of me %actor.name%.
* load some apprehension
%load% obj 1300
* reload the mob for the next questor
%load% mob 1311@n

The above script will be executed when the mob is killed - just before the 
death cry. The last script just needs to check if the object handed over is 
the correct one. Let's see it, here with vnum 2: 

> trigedit 2
Trigger Editor [2]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example 1310 - Give/Quest Completion@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yReceive@n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@c* check if this was indeed the right object
if %object.vnum% == 1300
  wait 1 sec
  say Thank you, %actor.name%
  %send% %actor% %self.name% gives you a gold piece.
  %echoaround% %actor% %actor.name% is rewarded for his valor.
  nop %actor.gold(1)%
  wait 5 sec
  %purge% obj 1300
else
  * this wasn't the right object - don't accept it
  say I don't want that - bring me back my apprehension.
  return 0
end@n

The script above is pretty self explanatory, but to clarify a bit: First check 
if the object is the correct vnum, then give the reward, and send messages to 
the player and others in the room. If it wasn't the object, reject it, and use 
the return value of the script to prevent the object being passed over. Lastly, 
and very importantly, 'end' ends the if. 

6. Attach the scripts - permanently  
   Proceed and add the scripts to the two mobiles through medit: 

> medit 1310
[medit menu]
Enter choice ? S
     Script Editor

     Trigger List:
     <none>

 N)  New trigger for this script
 D)  Delete a trigger in this script
 X)  Exit Script Editor

     Enter choice :
Here, add the scripts by typing N, then the script vnum: 
Enter choice : n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 0
Enter choice ? n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 2
Enter choice ? x

And add the trigger vnum 3 to the ogre in a similar manner. 

7. Done ?  
   The scripts are now attached to the correct mobs, and the players of your 
mud can now take the quest whenever they wish. This is a great time for 
considering improvements to the little quest: 

Balance issues: 
   Should players get a smaller reward if they perform the quest many times ? 
   Should it be limited to 1 quest per player or 1 per reboot ? 
Gameplay issues: 
   Perhaps other mobs in town should tell the player to go see the old man ? 
   Should the ogre always load the object, or only when people know he has it ? 
   Are there other mobs who would like to pay for that object ? 

The above list is just a few examples. All of them could be implemented, but 
it is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

TRIGEDIT-NAMES TRIG-NAMES
----------

1) Name         : @ynew trigger@n

Always use names that explain the trigger. More importantly: always include the
VNUM for the mob/obj/room the trigger is going to be attached to.

   It's important to give your trigger a name you and others can understand. 
Even more important is including the VNUM of what it is attached to. This way
tlist and stat will show the name description and VNUM allowing others to 
quickly comprehend what the trigger does. A good name could be 'guard shout for
help - 101' or 'mage cast poison - 300' even 'cursed object - 130.'

Examples:
   Quest Offer - 1310       --> trigger attached to mob 1310

trigger to react on people dying in the room, dropping objects, saying stuff, 
entering, jumping insanely up and down or whatever else you might think of.

This part is also the most important, in the sense that the rest of the triggers' 
info means different things, depending on what trigger type the trigger has. 

For a full listing of types see: @RHELP TRIGEDIT-TYPES@n

TRIGEDIT-VARIABLES VARIABLES TRIG-VARS TRIG-VARIABLES VARS 
----------

Variables appear as a name surrounded by '%'s, such as %actor% 

Before a command is processed, the line is scanned and any variables are
replaced. First the list of local variables are checked to see if the variable
is there. If not, the global variables are checked. A proper global match must
have a zero context or the current context of the script. (When a script starts
running, its context is 0. The script context command may be used to change
context.) If a match is still not found, a list of 'built in' variables (ones
not declared by the script) are checked. If no match is found, the variable is
replaced with an empty string (the variable is removed from the line, and
nothing added in its place).

There are two types of variables, local and global. All local variables are
deleted when a trigger finishes executing, and can only be used by the trigger.
Global variables remain until removed with unset, or the script is removed. 

Global variables also have a context associated with them. By default, the
context is 0. Any global being referenced with a context of zero will be seen.
Through the 'context <value>' command, a script may set its context to any
integer; Globals created are always assigned the current script context. When a
global is referenced, if it's context is not 0 or the current context of the
script, it will not be seen. This technique allows, among other things, arrays
of globals to be created by using a series of contexts as indexes. Also, it
allows globals to be associated with a specific character, room, or object in
the game, by using the id of the target as the context. 

Variable Fields 

A field of a variable can also retrieved, based on their type. To get a field,
a notation of %variable.field% is used. The valid fields are listed in the help
files below. 

@RCHAR-VAR@n - Variables for characters.    @RTSTAT 27@n
@ROBJ-VAR@n  - Variables for objects.       @RTSTAT 28@n
@RROOM-VAR@n - Variables for rooms.         @RTSTAT 29@n
@RTEXT-VAR@n - Variables for text.          @RTSTAT 30@n
@RSPEC-VAR@n - Variables for special stuff. @RTSTAT 31@n

TSTAT TRIGEDIT-EXAMPLES EXAMPLES TRIG-EXAMPLES
----------

Usage: tstat <trigger vnum>

Tstat lets you learn more about a specific trigger. 
Be warned that all the triggers on TBA may not work since anyone could
have made them. Ask around for the best examples. Zone 0 are the basic
examples. For more examples check out zones 13, 19, 27, 29, 77, 236 and 
237. There are numerous others. Look around, just beware some may not be
"good" examples. 

To learn more about any of these just tlist <zone #> then tstat each
trigger individually. You can always ask Rumble to find you an example.

TSUIHIDAN
----------
   
@wTsuihidan is a technique where the user fires a special kiball that homes in
on a particular target's ki signal. The user doesn't have to be able to sense
the target to use this technique and has no control over the attack after it is
released. This attack is good for targets that have a high chance of avoiding
standard attacks or who may try to escape, as the tsuihidan will follow them.@n

TUNNEL
----------
Usage: tunnel <direction> <room vnum>
       tunnel <direction> -1
This command will create a new exit from your current room to the target 
room, and if possible, create the reverse exit from the target room back
to the current room.
You can remove an existing exit by specifying a target room of "-1".

TWIN-SLASH
----------
   
@wTwin Slash is a technique where the user channels their charged Ki into a
sword. The user saves some of the charged Ki for their own body, using it to
boost their speed to pull off the attack. Two slashes that happen so fast they
appear to almost be a single slash make this a very dangerous attack for a
target to withstand. While it doesn't have a high maximum power, it has a
greatly increased chance to sever a limb should it strike it than any other
attack in its class.@n
   
@wTwin Slash is a perfectable and combinable attack.@n
   
Depending on your skill level and your weapon's tier level, Twin Slash will
provide a damage boost.

TWINK
----------

   "On MU* systems that specialize in role-playing, refers to behavior of a
(usually inexperienced) player that either ignores rules or social convention,
or disrupts the natural flow of a scene to show off super powers." 

   Basically what this means for the players of Dragon Ball Advent Truth, don't
be an idiot. Read the rules, understand them. If you do not know or for a

VOICE
----------

   The voice command allows you to set a voice description for SNET. This lets
you uniquely define the sound of your character's voice over SNET to be
specific. If you have already set a voice then you will have to pay 1 RPP to
change it everytime after. If it is your first time setting it though it is
free. You can see what voice you have set by checking status. 

   @RIMPORTANT@w: Voices that have names in them are illegal. Voices that are not
purely descriptive are illegal. Voices that an enforcer deems
inappropriate(like character names) must be changed immediately. If unable to
change due to lacking RPP the player must not SNET until they have the RPP to
change their voice or else they will be helled for 1 hour for every offense. 
Syntax: voice (text)

Example
---------
voice A quiet voice
snet Hello my friends.
What is seen: "A quiet voice is heard, [FREQ 1] Hello my friends."

WARP-POOL POOL
----------

   Warp Pool is a Hydromancy technique where the user connects two bodies of

seconds and will only accept the user through it. The bodies of water must be
large. Such as an ocean or sea. Currently there are only five known worlds
that have large enough bodies of water. Earth, Frigid, Kanassa, Namek, and
Aether. This technique was devised as a means of quick travel for Kanassans to
explore other oceans on other planets without the need for a ship and with the
safety of stealthly arriving on another world.

@wWater Razor is a Hydromancy skill that originates on the planet Kanassa. 
The user of the technique focuses an invisible force of Ki into a target's
body. With this Ki they take control of the water in the target's body and
cause all that water to form millions of microscopic blades for an instant. 
This damages the insides of the target's body immensely. It will damage their
Powerlevel, Ki, and Stamina about equally and at the same time. It is
important to note that Androids are immune to this technique as they do not
have enough water in them for it to work properly.@n

at a particular target. The strength and sharpness of the spikes is perfectly
formed by the technique allowing for incredibly strong and sharp projectiles.

WEIGHT
----------

   Weight worn and carried has an affect on your character. It reduces the
height their current powerlevel can reach in relation to their max powerlevel,
it reduces their speed index, and lastly it gives them a bonus to experience

these areas. 

   Your prompt and score powerlevel displays will reflect the state of your
current pl in relation to your max pl. If your current pl is at it's adjusted
max by weight it will be purple. If it is equal to your max powerlevel it will
be dark cyan. If it is above your max (via kaioken or a similar technique) it
will be bright green.

keywords wish and power you could say "I wish for myself to be granted great

ZEDIT
----------

Usage: zedit [<room number>]
       zedit new <zone> <bottom room> <top room>
       zedit save [<zone>]

The zedit command is used to create new zones, change the characteristics
of existing zones, and create and edit individual zone commands.

The first variant of the zedit command is used to change values for an 
existing zone and add or modify the zone commands that relate to a particular
room.  If no room number is given, zedit will work with the room the player is
currently in, or if a room number is specified, it will work with the zone
that contains that room.  The zedit menu is in two parts, the upper part 
being used to set the overall value for the total zone (zone name, reset
mode, and so on), while the lower part lists the zone commands that relate
to the particular room.

The second variant is used to create a brand new zone, specifying the zone
number and the range of room vnums that the zone contains.  This will bring
up the standard zone edit menu.

The third (and final) variant will save the complete zone to the disk file,
for either the zone specified or, if no zone number was entered, for the 
zone that the player is currently in.
