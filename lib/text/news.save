#1 Welcome Back!
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YMon Jan  2 16:18:16 2012@n
   Era four brings a few changes that are sure to be interesting to old and
new players alike. First and formost if the release of planet Arlia and the
Arlian race (along with sensei). On top of this there have been balance tweaks
to the rate money is earned as well as the way humanoid NPCs deal with combat.
Dragon Balls now have a selfishness meter that raises as more selfish wishes
are made. Some wishes raise it faster than other wishes and only one wish
lowers the meter (revival). When the meter passes a threshold the Dragon Balls
crack and release the dark energy stored within them in the form of Shadow
Dragons. These dragons spread out across the galaxy and must be defeated in
order to free up the Dragon Balls once again. The Shadow Dragons will persist
across MUD resets or the occasional crash. Lastly Dragon Ball hunters will
occasionaly load when the Dragon Ball set loads and will be in possession of a
ball themselves.

   Those with ships or items that are applicable contact immortals if you desire
them. We will not accept any late requests. You have until February 1st to
reacquire these things.

   Jinto also has a new technique to teach Hoshijin students. Star Nova
#2 New Things
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YTue Jan  3 19:47:26 2012@n
1: You must now set carve to on to get steaks from killing animals. You must
also pass a survival skill roll to successfully preserve the meat. 
2: Survival skill is used for building fires instead of build skill
3: Skills past skill level 50 will now have lower chances of auto-train per use.

#3 Important Tournament Being Held

#4 New Area Released
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YThu Jan  5 21:59:35 2012@n
   A new area in the Afterlife has been released. Good luck finding it if you
were unlucky enough to be dead in the first place. Not for super low level
characters either, so be careful.

#5 Tournament Matches
@cUpdated By@D: @CSamael        @cDate@D: @YThu Jan 12 19:41:43 2012@n
The first batch of tournament matches has been released: http://advent-truth.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=2718 Read the thread to find out who your opponent will be. Remember, Friday 13th is the start of the tournament and each night of fighting begins at 10PM EST.

#6 Arlian Evolution
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YThu Jan 12 23:48:30 2012@n
   The level costs for Arlian Evolution have been adjusted down for the most
part. Past certain levels they will spike up but arlians below Evo Level 50
should really notice a difference. Armor Index gains for Arlian Evolution have
been ironed out a great deal more as well.

#7 Arena
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YSun Jan 15 19:21:58 2012@n
You can now watch people in the arena. Read help arena for all the commands.

#8 Hide and Steal
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YWed Jan 18 03:53:31 2012@n
   Hide has been updated so that only specific actions or failure at actions
will reveal you to people in the room. (Unless your hide skill is low and they
can already spot you. ) The steal command has also been updated to be more
balanced. Read 'help steal' for further information on it.

#9 New Frigid Zone
@cUpdated By@D: @CSamael        @cDate@D: @YThu Jan 19 07:15:33 2012@n
   A new zone, or rather an expansion to an old one, has opened up on Frigid.
Many Icerian intellects have long pondered what secrets Glug's Volcano holds
and now you can find out. With the expansion of Glug's Volcano, the level
range for NPCs in that area have been bumped up slightly, to better fit the
dynamic of the planet also.

#10 Limb Loss...
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YThu Mar  1 19:33:30 2012@n
You now only lose limbs from attacks that actually hurt you somewhat.

#11 Website Down
@cUpdated By@D: @CAndros        @cDate@D: @YMon Mar  5 16:33:14 2012@n

The website is down for an unforseen ammount of time right now.

#12 New Things Of Wonderous Wonderful Wonderment
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YFri Mar  9 22:44:39 2012@n
1: Mob Damage has been upped somewhat
2: Damage Resistence has been nerfed somewhat (specifically armor and con). It hasn't been lowered a ton. Don't confuse the extent of this change with item 1.
3: Suppression is no longer as obvious when you are scouted.
4: Poison now prevents those poisoned from eating/drinking or charging ki.
5: Tribeam now drains 5% of the user's current PL for every 1% over the minimum it is charged. This is added to the damage of the attack.
6: You can now form NORMAL barriers at half the ki cost.
7: Spar gains have been tweaked to never be capped unless your TNL is negative.
8: The chances for limbs to be destroyed (instead of broken) have been lowered.
#13 New things of newness
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YSun Mar 11 21:14:20 2012@n
The nolin function has been improved for those who use screen readers.
@n @n
   The Augmenter 9001 has been added to two high tech areas. With this nifty
device you can permanantly raise a cardinal stat (such as strength) by 1 point.
That is if you can afford the cost. This is for those who are rich and too
lazy to weight train. The cost scales with the level of the stat.

#14 Shamrock is back
@cUpdated By@D: @CSamael        @cDate@D: @YMon Mar 12 22:33:52 2012@n
   Shamrock, the Konatsu with more wealth than he knows what to do with, is
taking off his reclusive shackles once again and appearing in public. What
prizes are in store? Will Shamrock's usually jovial visits remain as such? 
Only one way to find out!

#15 Update Landing Change
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YSun Apr 15 22:10:00 2012@n
   When you go to land on a planet from space without a ship (using the land
command) you will be asked where on the planet you want to land (you must type
this out exactly as it is read). These location names match up with locations
you would see via sense or scouter scans.
 
   Truffles, Demons, Mutants, and Konatsus have been changed so that they have
no RPP costs from level 40 or below (instead of 15 and below). This was done
to increase the desirability for players to use these races more often. This
may get tweaked in the future depending on the outcome.
 
   A new build object has been added. This object allows the owner (who has it
in their inventory) to detect the origin of SNET signals they receive (what
location they came from). It is not easy to build.

#16 Command Dig
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YTue Apr 17 13:48:57 2012@n
   The command dig has been added. In areas with dirt or sand you can now bury
an item (like maybe a corpse, bag, whatever your imagination decides). 
Whether you see a dirt mound from a buried object depends on your spot skill
(you can try and uncover things whether you noticed a mound or not though).
 
Also Kanassans have been added to the list of races with no RPP cost for leveling before level 40.

#17 Voice and RPP Changes
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YFri Apr 20 20:07:18 2012@n
   Several RPP command options have had some changes either in cost or quality
of effect. The voice command now only takes 1 RPP to change your voice is you
already set it before.

#18 RPP Menu
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YWed Apr 25 19:47:46 2012@n
   The Custom Equipment option on the RPP menu has been automated. You can now
build your own Custom Equipment (you don't choose stats though). As long as
you have the 30 RPP necessary you can start working on a custom piece. When
you go to quit the Custom Construction Menu it will ask you if you want to
purchase the equipment you designed. It will only charge you if you select
yes. Otherwise you will cancel and keep your RPP.
 
   For those who have old customs built by imms you are to trade them in for 50
RPP ASAP. You must then take 30 of that RPP and build yourself a new custom.

#19 Androids and Sense
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YSat Apr 28 01:44:49 2012@n
   Absorb Androids have been slightly tweaked. Now their powerlevel regen from
normal ticks has been reduced cosiderably and in its place they now regen part
of the PL while absorbing from victim. They don't steal from the victim's
powerlevel but instead convert some of the ki stolen into powerlevel (there is
no drop in the ki stolen though).
 
   Sense Androids have been majorly tweaked. All sense android transformation
upgrades give larger increases than other android models. 
 
Look forward to a change to balance out repair androids with these changes soon.
 
   Lastly sense has been updated so that if you have dubbed someone when a
sense message pops up (like sense scanning a planet or someone entering your
area) you will be told who they are instead of it just being another generic
signal detected.
#20 Repair Androids
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YTue May  1 15:12:01 2012@n
   Repair Androids now have the ability to repair all their worn equipment a
good deal with their repair ability. This happens at the same time this
ability restores their PL.
 
   Addition: The repair ability now has a chance to increase the current ki of
the repair droid now. If that ki is below maximum when repair is used.

#21 Pushup, Situp, Meditate
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YFri May  4 09:12:30 2012@n
   You now gain what you would gain from these everytime you do them. It's not
a random chance to gain anymore. This may change depending on the effect it
has. Consider it in place on a trial basis.

#22 Instant Transmission
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YSat May 26 22:22:49 2012@n
   It is no longer possible for someone who is below level 60 to enter the area
that teaches Instant Transmission and learn it. I am sick of all the lowbies
who have basically had Instant Transmission handed to them by higher level
characters farming the shit needed for them and walking them through the quest.
 
   You may still give the IT quest items to someone, but I caution you to do so
sparingly. If I need to curb this issue more I will. It should be something
people tend to earn on their own. Not something you basically gift wrap for
anyone you know whether IC or not.

#23 Prototype custom scouters
@cUpdated By@D: @CSamael        @cDate@D: @YThu Jun 14 12:38:16 2012@n
   Prototype custom scouters have been hit with the nerf gun, as they now have
a level restriction placed upon them.

#24 Future Expansion
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YThu Jun 21 14:47:23 2012@n
   I want to inform players that a future expansion is planned. This expansion
will not only include new world content to explore but also skills, trainers,
gameplay changes (such as how equipment drops and shop equipment are statted),
bug fixes, and other new things.
 
   This will @Rnot@n involve a player wipe. This expansion will come in all at
once on a date yet to be announce, though that date will be announced soon, and
it will have next to no negative impact on your playing experience. There will
be no serious downtime involved. All code and gameplay suggestions should be
made during the period before the expansion details are fully announced. You
may do so in the appropriate suggestion boards on the forum.

#25 Expansion

#26 Custom Equipment
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YTue Jul 10 20:47:57 2012@n
   Due to equipment changes custom equipment prior to the expansion should be
traded in as soon as possible. It will be refunded for the RPP it costed and a
new one must be made immediatly upon receiving the RPP. When the custom has
been rebuilt it will have 2 token slots in it.

#27 boards
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YWed Aug  1 06:38:17 2012@n
The MUD was down due to an error with the boards system.

#28 @RWither - Read@n

   If you happen to have acquired Wither, do NOT use it on another player for
the time being.

#29 Wither Fixed
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YMon Oct 22 03:05:46 2012@n
Wither has been fixed. That is all.

#30 Cerria Quest Fix
@cUpdated By@D: @CAndros        @cDate@D: @YMon Oct 22 12:48:00 2012@n
The Cerria scripts have been fixed.  Anyone who has advanced on any quests involved on that planet need to report to Sedalis to have their characters updated to match the changes.  The quest will not respond correctly if you have already started EITHER side, and if benefits are derived due to it, it could be seen as bug abuse, so it is important that you report to Sedalis for checking even if you're unsure.  This only applies if you have already taken quests from that planet.

#31 Halloween Event
@cUpdated By@D: @CSamael        @cDate@D: @YWed Oct 31 14:39:18 2012@n

   Additional skillslots can now be purchased for 5 RPP via the RPP store.

#42 Experience TNL Increases
@cUpdated By@D: @CSamael        @cDate@D: @YFri Feb  8 03:46:02 2013@n
   The experience required to level from level 40 onwards has been increased by
the following percents (not exact, but close), 40-60: 25%, 60-80: 50%, 80-100:
75%. These changes won't cause anyone to lose any levels, but you may notice
you are a lot further away from your next level than previously.

#43 Public Transport Upgrades
@cUpdated By@D: @CSamael        @cDate@D: @YSat Feb 23 23:49:11 2013@n
   The Celestial Corp Space Hub (a giant space station) has now been released.
It is fully featured, containing just about everything a player could need. 
The four existing public transport ships (falcon, simurgh, valkyrie and zypher)
have had their routes updated to stop at the space hub (check their respective
helpfiles). New ships are being added that only run between ONE planet and a
space hub as well (see help pheonix for example).

IMPORTANT: Anyone with an existing custom weapon should have it exchanged for RPP and remake the weapon so that the minimum level requirement is on that weapon. Get in contact with an IMM ASAP. Not taking care of this ASAP will lead us to assume you are cheating.

#46 NOOOOOOO
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YThu May  2 03:28:24 2013@n
   Samael wiped out the new weapon changes. I'll have to put them back in

#47 Combo
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YFri May  3 23:28:34 2013@n
Combo has been changed so that it has a base maxmimum of hits at the usual 20 mark,
but you gain +1 max attacks to the combo for every MASTERED physical attack skill you
have (basic skills). Combo now includes tailwhip, bash, and headbutt as well. Lastly
you get special bonus attacks to your maximum depending on how many physical skills
you have mastered.
 
 You also will not have skills you do not have suggested as part of your combo. You
must at least have three physical skills in order to combo though.

#49 Mob Tactics
@cUpdated By@D: @CIovan         @cDate@D: @YSun Jun 16 05:55:11 2013@n
Several changes have taken place concerning mobs and several more are planned.
 
   1: Non-humanoid mobs (like animals) have practically very little chance to
ever parry an attack and generally have reduced defensive abilities for their
levels (compared to humanoid)
   2: Humanoid mobs (like... Humans) have an increased ability to parry at
higher levels as well as having generally good defensive abilities based on
their levels (dodge and block).
   3: Certain mobs of certain races will be getting racial abilities to use
when they need to. Same thing for certain skills. Right now this is limited
to bioandroids regenerating (though within a day or so majins and nameks will
do this as well). Demons will have the ability to curse players, kanassans to
use hydromancy skills, and various other abilities (some new mob only ones).
   4: There will also be some new enemy flags that can be attached by builders
to give mobs more complex and potentially dangerous abilities. Like stealing
from a player's inventory (though generally weaker NPCs who can easily be
killed to reclaim the object), using restorative or buffing items/skills,
following a player even across zones or planet to planet (if it's capable of
such travel). These will not be on most mobs, but they will be on enough to
make them a consideration.
