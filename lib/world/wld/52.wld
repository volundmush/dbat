 @gThe ground here is primary dirt though it is quite rocky.  It appears like a
path has been cleared here, with only a bit of snowfall on it despite the snow
either side of the visible dirt that is comprised of.  That patch of snow is
barely a few feet wide either side of the dirt path, with quite a long drop
beyond that.  @n

 @gA pathway leading up a further incline on the Wyrm Spine is more evident than
the dirt pathways throughout the rest of the mountain, suggesting that it might
