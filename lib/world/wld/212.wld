@nThe @DBlack@n @rOmen@n: Airlock~
@nThe interior of this massive airlock seems to dward a person in size as the
ceiling sits perhaps twenty to twenty five feet above. The entire structure is
a mash of scraps from a thousand ships into the ancient bulwark. Circuits are
bare, and the composite metal that holds it all together is made of a dull
black substance, organic in nature though clearly metallic. A small @Ywarning@n
has been scratched onto the inside of the airlock. @n

@nThese halls reflect the outer shape of the massive ship and are pyramidal in
design. The strange black @Dmetal@n that seems to spider throughout the materials

The @DBlack@r Omen@n: Nest of the @YS@Wt@ya@Yr @YG@Wo@yo@Ys@We@n~
@nThis enclosed spaces looks like it might have once been a storage closet. From the appearance of it now though, it looks to have been taken over by an animal of some kind. Bits of rotting cloth, and ancient bits of scrap and broken pieces of the ship itself make up some strange sort of nest, sometimes occupied by its owner. The smell of animal is very strong in here, and the walls have been chipped and scratched repeatedly.

@nThe @DBlack@n @rOmen@n: Abandonded Living Quarters@n~
@nThese halls wind through what appears to be a veritable compound of housing
bunks, though long abandoned. Along the walls are many pod like inserts styled
almost like stasis pods and many of them are broken or have sustained heavy
damage, giving off small @Ysparks@n every once and a while. The entire complex is
eerily quiet, the conduit like pulses of energy ebbing and glowing the only
light.

This large, open area was once used for research by its appearance. Tables lie still, with yellowed and aged papers scattered about and experiments abandoned half way through. The papers are scrawled on with ancient script, and crumble to dust at the touch. This appears to be one of the places in the vast halls of the ship that still maintains steady light. The pulses found elsewhere through the strange black material seem to glow constant here.

@DBlack@r Omen@n:@W Laboratory@n - Research Area~
This large, open area was once used for research by its appearance. Tables lie still, with yellowed and aged papers scattered about and experiments abandoned half way through. The papers are scrawled on with ancient script, and crumble to dust at the touch. This appears to be one of the places in the vast halls of the ship that still maintains steady light. The pulses found elsewhere through the strange black material seem to glow constant here, and a small @Rkeypad@n can be seen on the western wall.

@nThis large, cavernous storage bay is enormous in size. Stretching out into the
dimly lit bay is row upon row of sentry android units, lined up in rank and
file like soldiers. Many of the units are in varying stages of decay and

@nThis room is spartan in design, bare of anything useless. The walls are covered in ancient and unreadable astrogation charts and star maps, written in some lost language. The room holds a simple desk and chair, somehow still preserved throughout the ages.

@nThe most forward portion of the command area is filled with various stations, all broken. Remnants of equipment lies in rubble everywhere, long since deteriorated into ancient garbage. A large viewing panel dominates the entire front portion of this Bridge deck, providing an ominous view of nothing but the vast reaches of deep space beyond. Occasionally, a piece of equipment will spit out sparks when one of the weak energy pulses makes its way through the strange hull of the ship.

@DBlack@r Omen@n:@W Command@n - War Room~
This large room is mostly dominated by a rectangular table. The surface is huge, and covered with displays and controls none of which seem to be marked. Several small stands or stools line the table on all sides and the room has the feeling of being a meeting place.

@nThe @DBlack@n @rOmen@n: @WLower Depths - Teleporter Pad@n~
@nThe entire floor of this room seems to be part of an ancient and advanced
transportation device. Pulses of @Yenergy@n cause the floor to light up and fade
at slow intervals. There appears to be a set of @Rcontrols@n on the wall, engraved
with strange markings. @n

controls~
@nStrange markings cover the various settings of this control panel. They seem
to be locked into place, but one of them looks like it can be @Rpressed@n. A
single words has been etched into the panel, reading @YLab@n.

@DBlack@r Omen@n: Lower Depths~
@nThe only light in this area comes a dull pulse of energy coursing through the
walls from somewhere deeper within. A dank and foul odor permeates the air
here making it almost unbreathable, you can almost feel the miasma of the air
befouling your clothing and skin. Ancient rusted out cages are strewn about
and stacked upon each other in several place, indicating these lower decks may
have once housed slave pens; Perhaps prisoner cells for the unfortunate. The
pulses of light cast a sinister shadow across the large hold rooms, sometimes
revealing crawling or shuffling movement in the darkness.

@nThe only light in this area comes a dull pulse of energy coursing through the
walls from somewhere deeper within. A dank and foul odor permeates the air
here making it almost unbreathable, you can almost feel the miasma of the air
befouling your clothing and skin. Ancient rusted out cages are strewn about
and stacked upon each other in several place, indicating these lower decks may
have once housed slave pens; Perhaps prisoner cells for the unfortunate. The
pulses of light cast a sinister shadow across the large hold rooms, sometimes
revealing crawling or shuffling movement in the darkness.

@DBlack@r Omen@n: Lower Depths~
@nThe only light in this area comes a dull pulse of energy coursing through the
walls from somewhere deeper within. A dank and foul odor permeates the air
here making it almost unbreathable, you can almost feel the @gm@yi@Ga@ys@gm@ya@n of the air
befouling your clothing and skin. Ancient rusted out cages are strewn about
and stacked upon each other in several place, indicating these lower decks may
have once housed slave pens; Perhaps prisoner cells for the unfortunate. The
pulses of light cast a sinister shadow across the large hold rooms, sometimes
revealing crawling or shuffling movement in the darkness.

miasma~
@gThis dank and disgusting air feels like literal filth on your skin, in your lungs - every atom of you it touches. Breathing it in makes the lungs burn, and breathing hard if you linger any length of time in these putrid bowels.@n

The @DBlack@r Omen@n: The @RMammon@n Machine~
@nThis large, cavernous room is huge even by this ship's standards. The only
light in the room comes from the strange, dull red @rpulsing@n that seems to surge
through the exposed wiring conduits throughout all of the walls at random. 
The walls of the room themselves seem to be part of some large and strange
contraption which has been savagely attached to an enormous creature in the
center of this space. Wires, braided cord, diodes and conductor rods have all
been brutally burrowed into the shell-like carapace of the thing that floats in
the air. @n

pulsing red crystal crystals~
@WThese large @Rred crystals@W spike out in many directions, pulsing together every few seconds. It appears as if something moves about inside them at their core. A single slot in in the mass, as if a singular piece is missing.@n

@DBlack@r Omen@n:@W Observation Deck@n~
This large, open area was once used as an observation deck. The protective glass offers a vast view of the empty space surrounding the ship as it floats through the void, preparing for its next jump. The south end of the room has a smaller version of the teleport pads scattered throughout the omen, complete with controls.
