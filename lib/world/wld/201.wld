 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @gThere is a lush green planet nearby here. Lazy clouds that at this altitude

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @RThit is the edge of the small Frigidus star. This star which the planet
Frigid circles is a red giant, and as such produces very little heat or light.
At this distance most ships can withstand the heat produced by the star. @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @YThit is the edge of the star planet Vegeta orbits. This star is of above
average brightness, but produces average heat for a star. At this distance most

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @RThit is the edge of the small Frigidus star. This star which the planet
Frigid circles is a red giant, and as such produces very little heat or light.
At this distance most ships can withstand the heat produced by the star. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @RThit is the edge of the small Frigidus star. This star which the planet
Frigid circles is a red giant, and as such produces very little heat or light.
At this distance most ships can withstand the heat produced by the star. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @RThit is the edge of the small Frigidus star. This star which the planet
Frigid circles is a red giant, and as such produces very little heat or light.
At this distance most ships can withstand the heat produced by the star. @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

@WMouth of a @RR@re@Rd@W Wormhole@n~
   @RThis area is just at the mouth of a red wormhole that seems to be going
through the very fabric of space. Very little else can be seen about it except
for occasional bolts of blue energy that swirl out into the outside space and
then disappear just as quickly. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

gases making up the nebula seem to only reflect light on the yellow spectrum
giving it its natural coloring. Occaional crackles of energy can be seen
rumbling through the cloud. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

gases making up the nebula seem to only reflect light on the yellow spectrum
giving it its natural coloring. Occaional crackles of energy can be seen
rumbling through the cloud. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @YThis bright mass of yellow gases is swirling through the void of space. The
gases making up the nebula seem to only reflect light on the yellow spectrum
giving it its natural coloring. Occaional crackles of energy can be seen
rumbling through the cloud. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n
