   @WThis large area is paved with bricks arranged in a pattern of a spiral.  
Many benches line the sides of the area on the sides of the square.  It is
evident that only foot traffic is allowed through the city square as no signs of
any cars are present.  The city's buildings can be seen in the surrounding
distances, giving this area a centralized view of the entire city.  @n

street that leads to the shopping district of the city.  A tight balance of road
repair and road wear and tear has created a road that is just good enough to

   @WThis road runs underneath a large glass roof, creating an atmosphere of
grandiosity.  Large metal beams hold the glass ceiling several stories above the
marble walkway that covers the surrounding floor.  Shops can be seen at all
edges of view, ranging from food vendors to large discount stores.  @n

   @WThis wide street has seen a lot of traffic and little repair.  Tears and
potholes adorn the road, creating obstacles for wary drivers to avoid.  The
occasional stop sign tends to be hidden behind trees and bushes adding to the
stress of driving in such an environment.  @n
