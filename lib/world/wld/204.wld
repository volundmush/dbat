 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @BThis area is just at the mouth of a blue wormhole that seems to be going
through the very fabric of space. Very little else can be seen about it except
for occasional bolts of blue energy that swirl out into the outside space and
then disappear just as quickly. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

@WDepths of Space@n~
 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @RThis area is just at the mouth of a red wormhole that seems to be going
through the very fabric of space. Very little else can be seen about it except
for occasional bolts of blue energy that swirl out into the outside space and
then disappear just as quickly. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @GThis bright green cloud of gas is made up of mostly gases that reflect the
green light spectrum. Gravity, energy, and even light effect its movements
through space. As slow as those movements appear to be. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @CA bright blue planet with several continents can be seen far below. Small
sattelites and and debris can be seen occasionaly shooting by at incredible
speeds, caught in this orbit. Clouds can be seen apparently sweeping across the
planet. From this distance though the clouds appear to be standing still. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

@WMass of a @mPurple @WNebula@n~
   @mThis dark cloud of gas appears to only reflect light on the purple spectrum.
This gas boils and moves, manipulated by gravity and energy flowing through space
as well as its own chemical reactions. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

This gas boils and moves, manipulated by gravity and energy flowing through space

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @mThis dark cloud of gas appears to only reflect light on the purple spectrum.
This gas boils and moves, manipulated by gravity and energy flowing through space
as well as its own chemical reactions. @n

@WMass of a @mPurple @WNebula@n~
   @mThis dark cloud of gas appears to only reflect light on the purple spectrum.
This gas boils and moves, manipulated by gravity and energy flowing through space
as well as its own chemical reactions. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @BNot far from here a large planet can be seen. With green land and clear blue
oceans the planet is the perfect picture of peace from this vantage point. The
planet reflects more light than most, seemingly being surrounded by a layer of
blue gas that reflects light. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @GA bright planet covered almost completely with green water can be seen not
far from here. Few islands with blue colored folliage can be seen dotting the
waters of the planet here or there. Fluffy clouds that from here appear to be
standing still can be seen sweeping across the surface of the planet. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @mThis dark cloud of gas appears to only reflect light on the purple spectrum.
This gas boils and moves, manipulated by gravity and energy flowing through space
as well as its own chemical reactions. @n

@WMass of a @mPurple @WNebula@n~
   @mThis dark cloud of gas appears to only reflect light on the purple spectrum.
This gas boils and moves, manipulated by gravity and energy flowing through space
as well as its own chemical reactions. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @YThis bright yellow star is of average size. At this distance the heat from

   @YThis bright yellow star is of average size. At this distance the heat from
the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so
intense that looking at it with unprotected eyes will blind an average being of

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n
