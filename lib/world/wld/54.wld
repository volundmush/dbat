 The swamp is dark and loomy, not much sun light breaks through the canopy of
twisted dark brown trees.  The ground beneath is soft and shifts under weight
with shallow water on top.  The real dangers are the sections that drop off and
become quite deep where large predators can hide easily.

 The swamp is dark and loomy, not much sun light breaks through the canopy of
twisted dark brown trees.  The ground beneath is soft and shifts under weight
with shallow water on top.  The real dangers are the sections that drop off and
become quite deep where large predators can hide easily.
