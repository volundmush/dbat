 @WThese concrete stands allow seating for anyone interested in watching the
tournament fights.  Sound systems have been built into the stands ever twenty
feet, so that that announcer can clearly be heard by all those seated.  
Trashcans have been placed near the bottom of the stands for any trash patrons
may have.  @n

to have seen quite a bit of use.  The room its self appears to have been built
to be the most sturdy out of any area of the mine.  A bank of surveillance
monitors can be seen along the north side of the room, providing images of most
of the mine.  Several of the monitors are off for some reason.  @n
