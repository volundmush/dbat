@gO@Dr@Gt@Wu@gs@Di@Ga@Wn @DT@we@Wmp@wl@De@n - @WChamber of the Heavenly Kaios@n~
   @DThe Chamber of Heavenly Kaios was built to honor the first ever Supreme Kais.
A statue for each one can be found in every corner of the room, though they
appear to have been defaced. The ceiling has holes in several places, allowing
light from outside to filter through down into the chamber. Roots grow up
through cracks in the floor, weaving and winding their way around the chamber
and up the aged walls. @n

   @yEighth wielder of the Holy Sword, @rKenrashi@y died to a curse from the
heathens. He relinquished it in his last moments, leaving it to his brother,
the ninth wielder, @rVenraki@y. Their struggles against the evils knew no end,
though Venraki lived a longer life. He soon retired from grief, leaving the
sword to a peaceful, skilled warrior for safe keeping, lest it be needed again.
The Holy Sword made its journey to a planet that once before had a guardian. @n
