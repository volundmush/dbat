@nT@Wh@ne @WM@no@Wo@nn: Lunar Crater@n~
This crater sits in the center of the lunar body that orbits the Earth. The
dust here is colorless and the crater is full of various holes and pits in the
lunar surface. Out of the corner of your eye you can catch shadows of what may
or may not be small, extraterrestrial creatures skuttling out of view.

@nT@Wh@ne @WM@no@Wo@nn: Damaged Crater~
@nThis piece of the Moon is floating away from the rest of the main body, barely
being held in place by the Moon's own minor pull of gravity. The deep black
void of space surrounds this place on all sides and one misstep could mean
drifting off into space. In the distance, several other chunks being held in
place can be seen just barely through the gloom. @n

This large pit like hole in the surface of the moon is crawling with what
appear to be drones. These robots mindlessly mine this piece of the moon in
search of @mM@Doo@mn@Dst@mon@De@n, a rare and precious material. The area is well light with
surface lights set up by someone making the drones and the quarry easy to see.

@WIntrepid Base:@n Lower Level Access@n~
@nThis is a sterile, narrow alcove that is harshly lit with halogen lighting and
a certain bland sense of design that screams of government. This alcove looks
wide enough to fit two people, and leads to a ledge which has a ladder leading
several stories down through shadowed darkness. @n A strange contraption is
here, and just like you got down, you feel like you might be able to @Ractivate@n
the device to go back @Rup@n. @n

@nThis is a dingy government issue break room that runs north to south, and there
are several cabinets and counters that run along the eastern wall. There's a
grungy sink and a microwave. A single mini-fridge for employee lunches and the

@WF@no@Dr@Wg@no@Dt@Wt@ne@Dn @WT@ne@Dm@Wp@nl@De@n: Main Chamber@n~
@nThis room has been lost to the memories of time, and looks the part. The floor
which was once smooth and tiled now lies jagged and broken underfoot. The air
is thick with imposing will and though there are no torches or sconces on the
wall, there is some flickering quality to the mysterious and dim lighting that
provides illumination here. @n

@WF@no@Dr@Wg@no@Dt@Wt@ne@Dn @WT@ne@Dm@Wp@nl@De@n: Prayer Alcove@n~
@nThis small alcoved room is set somehow apart from the rest of the temple
chamber. The space is tighter, forcing those who would seek the advice of
whatever God once called this home to suplicate themselves in prayer. The far
wall of the alcove has a small stone slab set into the wall, with a rivulet
carved down the middle and a small cistern below. @n

sacrifice~
@nThis cistern and stone slab have been used more recently in comparison to the
rest of this temple, though there's no evidence of whatever was sacrificed and
the blood in the cistern is long since dry. Shrewd observers might see
something @Rscrawled@n along the bottom the cistern. @n

@WF@no@Dr@Wg@no@Dt@Wt@ne@Dn @WT@ne@Dm@Wp@nl@De@n: Sanctum@n~
@nThis inner chamber is dark, and foreboding. The room has been carved into a
perfectly circular shape that forces the focus of the room inward toward the
center. Dominating the middle of the room is a large statue, vauge and
faceless but in the shape of a man. The walls are made of some strange mixture
of obsidion and something a little more organic.
