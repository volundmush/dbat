@DEdge@n Of The @WS@no@Wu@nt@Wh@D G@na@Wl@Da@nx@Wy@n~
   @nThe mouth of a wormhole ends in the never-ending blackness of space. 
Stretching out lies the distant @Rremnants@n of the @WS@no@Wu@nt@Wh@n @DG@na@Wl@Da@nx@Wy@n. This far out,
the quarter of the Universe is strangely dark, so few stars and solar systems
left. Like miniature pin pricks in the black curtain, the few distant stars
and planets that have survived the destruction can be seen.

@YBarren Dust Bowl@n - Center of the Valley@n~
   What was once a thriving civilization of @Ydesert@n people has been devastated
and left in a state of chaos. The remaining signs of those who once lived here
are scattered about like ancient @Yruins@n, and the acrid atmosphere of what's left
of this planet has turned it into a barren wasteland within a dust bowl. To
the northwest, tall imposing cliffs can be seen even from above the rim of the
valley; the sound of a vicious wind heard blowing down. The air is stale and
hot within the valley covered in sand, and all around small shattered
@cc@Cr@ny@Dst@ca@Cl@nl@Din@ce@n pieces can be seen glinting in the harsh sunlight. This seems like
a safe place to @Rtravel@n.

   @DThe bottom of the shaft is dry and sandy. The wooden support beams look
like they've been replaced at least somewhat recently, still holding some of
their natural color. The mineshaft is surprisingly clean and fresh, smelling
strangely of spices or fresh herbs. Signs of habitation can be seen here more
strongly, and the occasional murmurs of voices can be heard echoing from the

   @nThis is a small clearing, surrounded by shrubbery that creates almost an
austere atmopshere about the place. Once heralded as one of the finest views
of all of the @WS@no@Wu@nt@Wh@D G@na@Wl@Da@nx@Wy@n, now the vision beyond is as terrible as it once was
beautiful. From this height it's easier to see that the planet is all but
gone, this piece held together almost by stubbornness alone. The blackness of
space and the chaos storms above dominate the sky, and it becomes apparent how
few stars remain in what can be seen of the sky. @n
