@WTo play blackjack you must have at least 5 zenni. You can bet up to 25 when you say deal(ie. "deal 25"). 5 is the minimum bet though. If you have a hand value of 12 or less you will be allowed to raise up to 25 zenni more(50 total).

@w-How to play-@n
@Gsay deal@D:@w This deals you your first two cards.
@Gsay raise@D:@w This raises your bet to 25 zenni.
@Gsay hit@D:@w This gives you another card.
@Gsay fold@D:@w This allows you to quit a hand instead of playing it.
@Gsay stand@D:@w This has you stay with the cards you have and you compete against the dealer's cards.
@Ghand@D:@w This shows you your hand, it is a command not spoken.

@RWARNING@W Basic knowledge of blackjack is required if you don't want to lose your money a lot.
