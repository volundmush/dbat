@YSurvival Tips with Bartholomew Blackstone, 
Adventurer Extraordinaire!@n
@g-----------------------------------------------@n

@WSurviving in the wilderness can be tough! Nights 
can be cold, and without any light, you're at the
mercy of the creatures that can see in the dark! 
Not to fear, though, for good ol' Bart Blackstone 
is here to help!

@WMake sure to get plenty of wood! Without the 
proper kiln dried logs, you may have trouble 
keeping a fire that will last.

@WYou'll need at least @w3 quartered logs@W built in 
a pyramid to make a fire. With a little bitta elbow 
grease and some patience, soon your fire will be 
roaring like a lion!

@WYoull also find that laying next to a fire is quite 
relaxing, and it often gets me feeling energetic
and ready for the next adventure!@n

@g-----------------------------------------------@n
@YThis has been survival tips with Bartholomew 
Blackstone! Be safe, and good luck out there!@n

   @DThis darkly paved road leads into the only city on planet Vegeta, Vegetos. 
Large round buildings can be seen to the north. Past the buildings a taller
structure can be seen. The royal saiyan palace with its four towers can be seen
clearly from here. South of this area tall mountains can be seen rising up all
around the road that continues southward from here. @n

   @DThis darkly paved area leads into the only city on planet Vegeta, Vegetos. 
A good deal of the pavement has been covered up with loosely blown sand
originating from the desert to the west. Large dome shaped buildings can be
seen rising up to the east. Far to the northeast the royal saiyan palace can
also be seen with its four towers rising up into the sky. To the west from here
rolling dunes of sand can be seen. @n

   @cTwo large wood doors about twenty feet high and ten feet wide each open up
into a large marble room here. Very little outside light is leaking through
dozens of high windows, adding a red glow to the dark blue marble of the floor,
walls, and ceiling. @n

   @WThis room opens up to a pavilion where the bottom of a tower can be seen. 
The tower seems to be made out of some sort of white concrete and there is no
entrance at ground level for which to enter it by. A large dome shaped room can
be seen at the top of the tower and occasionally a palace guard can be seen
looking out one of its windows. @n

bunk beds. Foot lockers have been placed at the ends of each bunk bed allowing
for the warriors stationed in this barracks to store their things in the
lockers. Very little natural light or fresh air manages to enter the room
through slit like windows along the ceiling. As a result the smell of body odor
and sweat fills the air. @n

   @cThis marble area is chock full of mass produced and uncomfortable looking
bunk beds. Foot lockers have been placed at the ends of each bunk bed allowing
for the warriors stationed in this barracks to store their things in the
lockers. Very little natural light or fresh air manages to enter the room
through slit like windows along the ceiling. As a result the smell of body odor
and sweat fills the air. @n

   @cThis marble hallway is about ten feet wide with stone columns reaching from
the floor to the ceiling. In between the columns windows can be seen built into
the walls. Red light from the outside filters in smoothly and blends with the
blue colored marble for an eerie effect. @n
