are covered in lush green grass. The plains are open fields interspersed with
gently sloping hills and steep outcrops. The landmass here meets the ocean, as
the water gently laps it's edges. @n

   @WThe usual lush @Ggreen@W grass of planet @GN@ga@Gm@ge@Gk@W's plains have been stomped down
by the feet of dozens of @Rs@ro@Wl@nd@Di@We@rr@Rs@W, now @Yb@yrownin@Yg@W and dying. Otherwise, there is
little to no vegetation. Small makeshift huts have been built for the @Rs@ro@Wl@nd@Di@We@rr@Rs@W
of @CF@cr@We@ni@cz@Ca@W's army to stay in while they are there. @rF@Ri@Yr@Re@rs@W can be seen strewn
throughout the camp, in front of the various tents and small buildings. The
construction seems to have been very recent, as if they were not there for
long, and did not plan to be. The very center of the encampment has a large
tent, probably for the lead officer. @n

   @BThe oceans of Namek are wide and expansive, covering the majority of the
planet's surface. The water is varying shades of blue depending on the depths
below and is quite peaceful with very few waves of any large size. It gently
laps the nearby landmass. @n
