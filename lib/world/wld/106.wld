   @GWhile there is little vegetation itself to speak of, the landmasses of Namek

   @GWhile there is little vegetation itself to speak of, the landmasses of Namek
are covered in lush green grass. The plains are open fields interspersed with
gently sloping hills and steep outcrops. The landmass here meets the ocean, as
the water gently laps it's edges. @n
