   @yUpon entrance, the room emits a gentle muddy smell. The walls are a dark
golden hue, much the same as the floor. Near the ceiling of the tunnel, and
along the walls at varying intervals, squirming bugs emitting their own light
from bioluminescence light up the surroundings. @n

   @yFilled with varying types of flora, this garden gives off a serene feeling.
Insects buzz about, continuing the cycle of life, while water trickles among the
roots to keep the plants alive. Lining the walls in strange patterns are bugs
giving off a glow that provide the life for the plants, and the ability to see.
