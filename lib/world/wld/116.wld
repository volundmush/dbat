@WThis large structure is where Namekian warriors used to come to train and test their strength. The walls and ceiling form a large, grungy off-white dome that has seen better days; the floor underfoot a drab, cold steel. A dimly glowing orb hangs from the middle of the abandoned dome, providing light to the area. In the back, there's a small hatch leading downward.@n

   @WGrease covers sections of the walls closest to a counter that is equally
stained with grease. A large menu of tasty 'food' is displayed above the
counter. An easy to use cash register with food icons for buttons instead of
numbers sits on top of the counter. Tables can be seen in the back, a few of
which should be safe to eat on. @n

   @CThis is the Namekian branch of Amnu-Nation. It's quite small and doesn't see
a lot of business. There are two shelves pushed up against opposing walls. On
the left, the shelf is full of various types of firearms, while the shelf is
quite bare, with only a few close combat weapons present. @n

protect them in the event of a battle. The place doesn't look like it gets much

   @gGamu's Supplies specializes in hand-crafted Namekian goods. There is a
glass counter with a sign on it reading 'For Sale' and there are several items
neatly arranged inside. Behind the counter is a wooden chair, where Gamu
usually sits. The rest of the goods are located in the middle of the white
hut, in a large bin of sorts that customers have to dig through to find goods.

@YSurvival Tips with Bartholomew Blackstone,
Adventurer Extraordinaire!@n
@g-----------------------------------------------@n

@WSurviving in the wilderness can be tough! Nights 
can be cold, and without any light, you're at the
mercy of the creatures that can see in the dark! 
Not to fear, though, for good ol' Bart Blackstone 
is here to help!

@WMake sure to get plenty of wood! Without the 
proper kiln dried logs, you may have trouble 
keeping a fire that will last.

@WYou'll need at least @w3 quartered logs@W built in 
a pyramid to make a fire. With a little bitta elbow 
grease and some patience, soon your fire will be 
roaring like a lion!

@WYoull also find that laying next to a fire is quite 
@Wrelaxing, and it often gets me feeling energetic
@Wand ready for the next adventure!@n

@g-----------------------------------------------@n
@YThis has been survival tips with Bartholomew 
Blackstone! Be safe, and good luck out there!@n

converted into a personal stufy, much of the warrior's own thoughts and
research scattered around the room. Before him sits a few soft pillows on the
