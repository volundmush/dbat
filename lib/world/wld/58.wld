Inside the Van~
   The inside of the van is almost totally empty. The front of the van has a
makeshift wall built to seperate the front from the back, and in the back there
is just some rope, a blindfold, and what appears to be a gag of some sort.

   The entire establishment seems to sparkle with cleaniness. Literally
sparkle. There is the faint smell of cleaning products in the air, but it is
overpowered by the scent of fudge, chocolate and caramel. Several large
coolers frame the left-most wall of the room, filled with take home containers
of your favourite icy treats. Several booths, and tables are scattered around
the room- an upbeat synthesized jingle plays on an endless loop from speakers
tucked into the corners of the roof. The counter is a see-through plexiglass
display cabinet filled with a literal rainbow of colours and flavours. Some of
the flavours are unusual, and several of the ice creams have a strange glean to
them.
