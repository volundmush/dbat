   @GThe @WC@was@Dt@wl@We@G looms in the distance to the north. A chasm between here and the
castle forms a natural barrier to the entrance, however. Without the ability
to fly, the jump to the other side could be a daunting task. Below, the chasm
is deep enough that the bottom is hidden by total @Ddarkness@G. @n @RJump@Ging seems the
only way to cross the @Dchasm@G. @n

   @GThe @WC@was@Dt@wl@We@G looms over you here, but it looks like half of it has been either
submerged or covered by the ground. The castle looks incredibly old, and the
dirt piled on it is not loose as would dirt that had been piled there recently.
To the south is a giant chasm that forms a natural barrier to the entrance. @n

   @wThe walls of this ancient castle hallway are old almost past imagining. 
The slightest sound sends dust skittering from the walls and ceiling. Rather
than stones fitted together with morter, the hallways seems to be the hollowed
out section of what must have been an incredibly enormous piece of stone. @n

   @wThe walls of this ancient castle hallway are old almost past imagining. 
The slightest sound sends dust skittering from the walls and ceiling. Rather
than stones fitted together with morter, the hallways seems to be the hollowed
out section of what must have been an incredibly enormous piece of stone. @n

   @wThe inside of the castle is much cleaner than the exterior areas. To the
south, east, and west, rubble fills what must have once been hallways. A
landing hangs overhead to the south, and what must have been two extravagant
stairways are now only rubble lining the east and west walls. @n

@DA Deep Chasm@n~
   @wThis @DChasm@w is quite deep. The wall to the north is a sheer cliff face, and
there is no way that it can be climbed. To the south, the cliff face is less
unforgiving. Climbing up the south cliff seems within the realm of
possibility. @n

@DA vast, impossible emptiness@n~
   @DNothing can be seen in any direction here. The nothingness is so complete
as to be disorienting if one keeps one's eyes open long enough. The very
fabric of the place seems to draw the life and existence of anything within it
out and into the vast expanse to become one with the nothingness. It is a slow
process, but can be felt immediately upon entering it. @n
