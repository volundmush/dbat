@gK@Ga@Di@Gj@gu @GF@go@Wr@De@gs@Gt @n- @WA thinning of trees~
   @gThe trees start to thin out here, due to battles that have been waged. 
Charred stumps of trees are all around, the only sounds that can be heard come
from the Makai in the forest. The heavy smell of smoke drifts by from the
west, and in the distance, you can see a column of smoke in the air. @n

being packed with peoples stuff. Fights break out in places from being packed
to gether so much.

the city have little damage on them, so they can still be usable to keep out
anyone who wants in. The gate lies to the east, in almost perfect condition.
To the north, south, and west lay streets to diferent parts of the city. You
can see a tall, smoking building to the west.

streets, with the occasional body part sticking up out of the rubble. Smoke
wafts through the area as a slight breeze passes, filling the air with a foul

other levels of the spaceport are ether totally destroyed, or about to

place. Enterences to the giftshops and restaraunts are all destroyed, few
corpses in the rubble. Through the glass and holes to the landing pads, you
can see the smoking remains of starships.

   This building has seen better days. The door lays shattered all around, the
ceiling has caved in in places, and through the holes you can see the smoke
rising from other parts of the city, while light from near by fires filters
through the holes. Some corpes lay under the rubble, some crushed, and some
showing the signs of torture.

   The center streets are lined with houses of different types. Smaller houses
on the outside, and get taller as they move to the center. Most of the
buildings lie in smoldering ruins, while some are mostly intact with only a
window, or door missing.

   You stand in the center of the city, smoke rising from ruined buildings all
around. Cries for help can still be heard from throughout the city, and
explosions rock the area every once in a while.

the city have little damage on them, so they can still be usable to keep out
anyone who wants in.

   Signs of battle mark the entire street. Collapsed buildings line the with
the occasional body part sticking up out of the rubble. Smoke wafts through
the area as a slight breeze passes, filling the air with a foul odor. 
Screaming and laughter can be heard from someplace else in the city, while
explosions shake the area.

   This intersection has been hit the most, as it is right infront of the City
Hall. Corpses from both the local military, Makai, and even civilians are all
over the place. Craters from explosions line the streets and near by
buildings. There is evidance that there used to be a small garden infront of
the City Hall, but it has all been blasted away.

   This street lies in ruins. Craters from explosions are all over the place,
some still smoking. Bits of destroyed buildings block the allyways, some
having a hand stick out from the middle. Corpses line the streets, while
screams and more explosions can be heard from all around.

   This street seems to have been full of shops. Signs hang off the ruined
buildings. Some were made out of wood or some other material, while some seem
to have had electricity running through them and lay sparking from broken
frames. Goods from the various stores spill out onto the street and can be
seen lying next to corpses. You have to wonder if some of the victims were
just out buying the fixings for dinner or out celebrating the end of the work
week and instead, met the horrible death that they did. Screams and laughter
can be heard throughout the street, indicating that survivors may be trapped,
or are being hunted.

   This street seems to have been full of shops. Signs hang off the ruined
buildings. Some were made out of wood or some other material, while some seem
to have had electricity running through them and lay sparking from broken
frames. Goods from the various stores spill out onto the street and can be
seen lying next to corpses. You have to wonder if some of the victims were
just out buying the fixings for dinner or out celebrating the end of the work
week and instead, met the horrible death that they did. Screams and laughter
can be heard throughout the street, indicating that survivors may be trapped,
or are being hunted.

   This street lies in ruins. Craters from explosions are all over the place,
some still smoking. Bits of destroyed buildings block the allyways, some
having a hand stick out from the middle. Corpses line the streets, while
screams and more explosions can be heard from all around.

   This building has seen better days. The door lays shattered all around, the
ceiling has caved in in places, and through the holes you can see the smoke
rising from other parts of the city, while light from near by fires filters
through the holes. Some corpes lay under the rubble, some crushed, and some
showing the signs of torture.

   One of the double doors lay tilted on one hinge, while the other is
completly missing. Corpses line the entery way, mostly the military. Fires
burn in some parts, while other parts have collapsed completely, making some
areas inaccessible.

   The hallway has small fires, but is mostly intact. The ceiling as collapsed
in some places, but the doors to some of the offices are still clear. Corpses
continue to pile up, but this time theres more civilians then Makai and
soldiers.

   This office has explosion marks all over the place. Fires from other parts
of the building have made their way to this room, catching the papers that
litter the floor on fire. A few corpses from people who tried to fend off the
Makai lay behind a desk, that looks to have been sliced in half.

   The fire hit this hallway a little worse, and has made the ceiling collapse,
preventing access to the hallway to the south. Corpses line up infront of the
staircase, the defenders having a good defensive position there. Some of the
corpses of the defending force have cuts on them, along with the staircase its
self being cut up.

   Some Makai, soldiers, and even a few civilians who were unlucky lie in piles
all around the room, to help keep the main hallways clear for the invading
troops. There is a terrible oder in the room as corpses catch fire.

   The staircase shows signs of fire, but they look to have been put out by
someone. Few corpes line the stairs, some showing cuts, some showing wounds by
other weapons. The railings on the side of the stairs have all been cut up,
and blood that runs down the stairs makes them hard to walk on.

preventing access to the diferent hallways. The fires have seem to have gone
out mostly, ether by someones doing, or from just loosing its strength. 
Corpses still line the hallway, but there seems to be less now.

   There is almost no sign of damage in this part of the hallway. Corpses
still line the hallway, but instead of there being more then ten, there is
around three or so. You can tell that the hallway once was bright. Pictures
lay all over the floor, tables that used to line the walls lay scattered. The
walls are covered in a bright @Ccyan@n color, with diferent colors along it in
ornate patterns.

   This room has no signs of battle damage yet. A golden chandalier sits in
the center of the ceiling, flickering slightly due to the damage to the
buildings structure. The colors of the walls are mostly golden, but not
overwhelming. A desk sits in the middle of the room, with a big, comfy looking
chair behind it. A large window is on the right side of the room, giving a
good view of the city. The corpses of the last remaining guards lay infront of
the door, their corpses bearing slash marks on them.
