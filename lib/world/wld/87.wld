 @cThis street leads straight through the town of St Alucia, which looks as if
its seen better times.  The windows of houses have been boarded up.  Doors are
bolted closed or in some cases, creak open and shut slowly on their hinges, as
the wind rolls through the street.  It looks like a Ghost Town though there does
appear to be signs of life.  There is a sinister feeling to this place.  @n

 @cThis inn is run down and doesn't appear to have seen many visitors in recent
times, much like the rest of St Alucia.  The inn is probably the only building
in town, whose windows remain unboarded.  The smell of fresh flowers waft in the
air, over-riding the general smell of death and staleness that is present
elsewhere.  @n
