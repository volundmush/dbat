@rG@Re@Dr@Wo@w'@Ws @rL@Ra@Wb@D: Entrance@n~
   @WThis area appears to be the entrance to Gero's Laboratory. A shiny titanium
plated floor gleams, reflecting the white lights burning on the ceiling. The
walls and ceiling appear to be some type of reinforced concrete with dark green
paint on them. A steel door with a @Gpanel@W next to it can be seen towards the
south. Next to the door a @Gsign@W has been hung. A ladder leads down through
awide hole. @n

@rG@Re@Dr@Wo@w'@Ws @rL@Ra@Wb@D: Advanced Model Labs Storage Room@n~
   @WThis mostly concrete room has row after row of body sized metal capsules
bolted to the floor. The capsules look like metal caskets with glass windows
about five inches by five inches built into their lids. Panels controlling
each capsule have been built into their respective sides, allowing any operator
to open or close the capsules. @n

@rG@Re@Dr@Wo@w'@Ws @rL@Ra@Wb@D: Level 4 Stairwell@n~
   @WThis concrete stairwell has no decorations and very little light. The steps
have a single steel rail running down the center of the stairs. The stairs
themselves do not drop that far, seemingly only a single floor in distance. A
sign can be seen posted above the stairwell entrance. @n

   @wThis plain concrete room doesn't look as if its owner cares much for
decorations. Dull white lights illuminate several bookcases lined up near the
entrance to the room. Beyond those bookcases a study area and sleeping area
can be seen with plain brown carpeting covering the floor in those two areas.

   @WHalf of this large room is filled with rows of bookshelves that reach nearly
to the nine foot tall ceiling. The other side of this concrete room a steel
desk with many different computer monitors located on it can be seen. On a
clear spot of the desk blueprints and diagrams of android models can be seen.
