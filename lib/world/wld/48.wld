 @mThis smaller fenced area is much like the main slaveyard, with high
barb-wired fences that have powerful currents of electricity pulsing through
them.  The difference here is several ki barriers formed as cells that keep in
some of the more dangerous slaves.  @n

   @WThe room is large and in the shape of a dome. @CA large mural of an Icerian
Lord in the center of a star sits centered in the middle of the dome. @WSmall
windows allow a little bit of outside light to come it, @Cbut for the most part
the room is lit up with fancy lamps that give off a soft white light. @n
