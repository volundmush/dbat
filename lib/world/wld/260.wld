   @cThis rancid, stagnant pit of standing water is almost thick enough to walk
on instead of through. The sound of the water occasionally lapping at the rock
echoes off of the narrow walls here, bouncing off of the rock and sending the
sound off down the warren-like tunnels. Sometimes, the sound of a soft hiss
can be heard coming from somewhere in the water. @n

   @DThese tunnels are rank with the smell of @ym@go@yl@gd@D and @nm@Di@nl@Dd@ne@Dw. The walls carry a
slimey-looking algae along them in some places, making the ground underfoot a

tunnels passable. @n

   @yFrom the center of this large cavern rises up a mass of @gv@Gi@gn@Ge@gs@y and branches
that seem very much alive. Twisting and wreathing together, the growth has
melded together into a large throne surrounded by blooming @Rf@rl@Ro@rw@Re@rr@Rs@y that seem in
perfect harmony with the @Gg@ga@Gr@gd@Ge@gn@y surrounding it. @n

   @yThis large cavern stretches out into the dim shadows of the underground
network of tunnels that crawl throughout. Looking around, the determined
movements of Namekian warriors can be seen toting supplies, or ducking in and
out of the smaller caves and crevice that make up much of this underground
camp. Not much noise is made by anyone that isn't neccesary, which makes the
steady @cdrip@y of water falling from the stalctites far above. @n

   @yThese tunnels grow even darker as they twist and turn into the very depth of
the planet's crust. Pitch black, the sound of skittering creatures can be
heard running from any light that may come floating down these tunnels. Ever a
steady backdrop to the eerie silence, the slow @cdrip@y of water from the ceiling
above. @n

   @yIn this small cavern, a few small clusters of Namekians have gathered. 
Crammed in like sardines, many of them sleep head to toe as they can in many
small spaces just like this one, elsewhere out in the maze of caves. The air
here is somewhat stale, and smells of too many bodies in too small a space. @n

   @nThis small laboratory has been especially sized for its owner, who can
almost always be found tinkering around in one corner or another. The walls of
the tunnel's end are lined with schematics and the surface areas that have been
setup are littered with half-finished or unfinished projects scattered all
about. The light here comes mostly from the laboratory equipment, with the
occasional flash or blip. @n

@yThis large cavern stretches out into the dim shadows of the underground network
of tunnels that crawl throughout. Looking around, the determined movement of
Namekian warriors can be seen toting supplies, or ducking in and out of the
smaller caves and crevice that make up much of this underground camp. This
quiet corner is almost peaceful, but for the stacks of boxes and crates that
cram the entire space. The silence is only broken by pained screams coming
from the Namekians that are here. @n

@DA sunken cave@n~
   @DA small, simple cavern that lies beneath the surface of the planet's crust.
A tunnel from above leaves a precarious climb down, and more rough passageways
cut their way to the north into the dark. Boots scrape against rough gravel
and loose earth with every footstep, to meld with the sound of skittering
creatures further in. @n

   @yThis is a small, almost cramped tunnel that's been hidden away here from the
rest of the sprawl. The narrow passageway digs itself further into the rock,
before branching off into two directions. To the northeast, light from some
kind of laboratory can be seen. Forking southwest is another passage. In the
distance, the faint sounds of something mechanical can be heard. @n

@yHidden Tunnel@n~
   @yThis is a small, almost cramped tunnel that's been hidden away here from the
rest of the sprawl. The narrow passageway digs itself further into the rock,
before branching off. From around the bend in the tunnel, the faint sounds of
something mechanical can be heard. The slight shift of fresh @Ca@ci@Cr@y comes from
the northwest. @n

   @yThese tunnels grow even darker as they twist and turn into the very depth of
the planet's crust. Pitch black, the sound of skittering creatures can be
heard running from any light that may come floating down these tunnels. Ever a
steady backdrop to the eerie silence, the slow @cdrip@y of water from the ceiling
above. @n
