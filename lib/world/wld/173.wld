   @WThis expansive room is mostly empty except for a few small ships that have
been parked here or there. One of the ships appears in the process of
undergoing engine repairs and had parts on the hangar floor close by. A large
extension to the hangar appears to be a ship sized airlock that allows ships to
enter the hangar without exposing the inside to the vacuum of space. @n

   @wA security @gpanel@w is built near an opening towards the south. A shield of
energy can be seen covering the opening. @n

   @WThis dark grey room is smeared with blood and feces. It appears a great
number of strange creatures have been living in this pen. Small white lights
in the ceiling and floors barely give enough illumination for the entire room.
This causes it to have an eerie atmosphere. @n

@mA@Ml@wp@Wh@wa@mr@Mi@ws @WSp@wac@De-@Wst@wat@Dio@Wn@D: @cElevator - 4th Floor@n~
   @cThis circular elevator has four sets of steel doors leading outside the
elevator car in each of the cardinal directions. The walls of the elevator car
are made of some strange artificial material resembling dark cyan plastic. A
red display above each set of doors indicates what floor the elevator car has
stopped on. In the center of the elevator car a small button @Gpanel@c can be seen
atop a column. @n
