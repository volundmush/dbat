   @DThis part of the volcano appears to be a narrow ravine made out of extremely
old volcanic rock. The ridges of the ravine have crumbled and become more
rounded from age. Broken bones of large unidentifable creatures can be seen
lying around the ravine in large piles. Nearby the piles small dark caves can
be seen leading down into the rock walls of the ravine. @n

   @DThis part of the volcano is relatively lower then the rest of it. The
volcanic rock that formed this part of the volcano was never very high and has
crumbled low with age. The footing is treacherous with lots of sharp broken
boulders lying about. @n

@DF@Wi@wsta@Wr@Dl @rVo@Rlc@yan@Yo@W: @DCentral Ravine@n~
   @DThis ravine runs through the center of the volcano on a north/south axis. 
The high jagged volcanic rock that makes up the cliffs of the ravine can be
seen towering to either side. Loose bits of this rock has crumbled with age
and piled up in heaps upon the ravine floor. @n

   @DThis path lies in the midst of an old lava channel that has long since
cooled. The dark rock has a rough uneven shape to it that had formed a
semi-pipe like structure from the direction of its flow long ago. @n

   @yThis small pathway appears to have been recently cleared of volcanic rock.
Toward the west of it a large group of round buildings can be seen. Along the
path westward various kinds of green plantlife can be seen growing to the north
and south. Most of this plantlife appears to be young, having been planted
only within that past few years. @n

   @DLarge dark rock rises up high to the east. In the side of this rock a wide
opening can be seen. Absolutely no light seems to penetrate into the cave
beyond the opening and the sounds of screams can be heard from deep within. @n
