 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @DThis dark area of space is populated by thousands of different sized
@yasteroids@D. They float around slamming into each other and anything else that
happens to get in their way. A thick cloud of dust floats through the field as
well affecting any light that happens to be passing through. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

@WDepths of Space@n~
 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

@yAsteroid Field@n~
   @DThis dark area of space is populated by thousands of different sized
@yasteroids@D. They float around slamming into each other and anything else that
happens to get in their way. A thick cloud of dust floats through the field as
well affecting any light that happens to be passing through. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @DThis dark area of space is populated by thousands of different sized
@yasteroids@D. They float around slamming into each other and anything else that
happens to get in their way. A thick cloud of dust floats through the field as
well affecting any light that happens to be passing through. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @rA dull, brown and red planet with a single super continent and no bodies of
water, can be seen far below. Small debris can be seen occasionaly shooting by
at incredible speeds, caught in the planet's orbit. Light brown and orange
colored clouds can be seen apparently sweeping across the planet. Though, from
this distance the clouds appear to be standing still. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @cA murky world can be seen far below. It's surface is mostly water with a
few islands scattered about. The islands appear to be covered with recently
formed craters. Large storm clouds move along the surface of the planet
continually, obscuring parts of it from view. From this distance though the
turbulant clouds below appear to be standing still. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @YThis bright yellow star is of average size. At this distance the heat from
the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so
intense that looking at it with unprotected eyes will blind an average being of
the universe. @n

   @YThis bright yellow star is of average size. At this distance the heat from
the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

few islands scattered about. The islands appear to be covered with recently
formed craters. Large storm clouds move along the surface of the planet
continually, obscuring parts of it from view. From this distance though the
turbulant clouds below appear to be standing still. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @cA murky world can be seen far below. It's surface is mostly water with a
few islands scattered about. The islands appear to be covered with recently
formed craters. Large storm clouds move along the surface of the planet
continually, obscuring parts of it from view. From this distance though the
turbulant clouds below appear to be standing still. @n

   @cA murky world can be seen far below. It's surface is mostly water with a
few islands scattered about. The islands appear to be covered with recently
formed craters. Large storm clouds move along the surface of the planet
continually, obscuring parts of it from view. From this distance though the
turbulant clouds below appear to be standing still. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @cA murky world can be seen far below. It's surface is mostly water with a
few islands scattered about. The islands appear to be covered with recently
formed craters. Large storm clouds move along the surface of the planet
continually, obscuring parts of it from view. From this distance though the
turbulant clouds below appear to be standing still. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @cA murky world can be seen far below. It's surface is mostly water with a
few islands scattered about. The islands appear to be covered with recently
formed craters. Large storm clouds move along the surface of the planet
continually, obscuring parts of it from view. From this distance though the
turbulant clouds below appear to be standing still. @n

   @YThis bright yellow star is of average size. At this distance the heat from
the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so
intense that looking at it with unprotected eyes will blind an average being of
the universe. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @YThis bright yellow star is of average size. At this distance the heat from
the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so
intense that looking at it with unprotected eyes will blind an average being of
the universe. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n
