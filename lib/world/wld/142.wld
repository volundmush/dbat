   @GThis part of the cliffs is made entirely out of a massive green crystal that
sparkles in any light source and has been polished by the wind to a flat smooth
surface. This is the single biggest attraction of the cliffs for any visitor.
A true marvel to behold. @n

   @GThis is the highest point of the Jade Cliffs formation. Weather and time
have worn the brown and yellow rocks down revealing a large chunk of green
crystal that poked up to form the highest point. Its jagged tip sparkles in the
sunlight and can be seen for miles. @n
