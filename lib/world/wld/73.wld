@yOutside A Cave@n~
   @yThis small ledge extends out from the entrance of the Twilight Caverns. A
large hole in the cliff wall leads into a dimly lit but sparkling cave. Below
the ledge yellow clouds can be seen floating slowly by in massive quantities.
Far below those clouds you can see parts of what appears to be a long winding
road suspended in the sky. Maybe one could @Ghop@y down to that road if they were
crazy. @n

@WA @Rsign@W is posted to a rock here.@n

   @mThis dimly lit chamber appears to be made out of a unique type of rock that
is only found in these floating cliffs. This dark purple rock has a unique way
of catching any stray rays of light that hit its edges and reflecting them back
as soft sparkles. The sounds of dripping water can be heard throughout the
chamber presumably from the moisture on the cave ceiling falling to the cave
floor. @n

   @mThese winding cavern tunnels are made out of the same rock as the rest of
the Twilight Caverns. There is quite a bit more light and fresh air in these
tunnels though as they are close to the surface entrance of the caverns. It
appears that sometime in the past people dug out the natural cavern walls to
expand these tunnels. The reason for this is not obvious by staring at the

   @mThese tunnels appear to fall between the surface level of the cavern and the
lower depths. The air here isn't quite as fresh as the surface level but it
has a taste of freshness to it and still gets ample light reflected throughout
the caverns. The expansion of the natural tunnels by unknown tools is more
obvious here as well. Finally certain chunks of the walls have been tunneled
out in what appears to be past mining attempts. @n

   @mThese tunnels appear to fall between the surface level of the cavern and the
lower depths. The air here isn't quite as fresh as the surface level but it
has a taste of freshness to it and still gets ample light reflected throughout
the caverns. The expansion of the natural tunnels by unknown tools is more
obvious here as well. Finally certain chunks of the walls have been tunneled
out in what appears to be past mining attempts. @n

   @mThis part of the caverns appears to be a natural formed expanse. Very
little work was done on it and it's probably a good thing too. It does not
look like the cavern would be able to hold together at this expanse if it had
been mined like the rest of the tunnels. @n

@YFalling Through The Clouds@n~
   @YYellow clouds rush past you as you fall steadily through them. Something
about the clouds and this general area of the Afterlife appears to have an
negative affect on flying abilities. You can do nothing but helplessly plummet
from here until you find something solid beneath you! @n
