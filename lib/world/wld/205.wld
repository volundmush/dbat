   @WThe inside of this ship is cramped, with little space to move about. A
control panel sits in the front with two chairs serving as the pilot and the
co-pilot sit in front of it, facing the spacious window to the outside. One
chair faces the west wall, and another faces the opposite- one for weapons
control and the other for system maintenance and diagnostics.

   @WA large window covers the front of the ship, wrapping around round. The
controls sit in the middle, the console wrapping around below the window. 
Various displays that show different statistics about the ship hang from above
where another Celestial Corp logo can be seen. To the right of the chair a
large display takes up most of the console and displays a map of the region. @n

   @WThe cargo hold of the small ship is almost pure white inside with a large
Celestial Corp logo, outlined in black to help it be seen, on the floor with
large racks for storage containers lining the left in right walls. To the rear
of the cargo hold you can see a large hatch that takes up most of the back of
the ship that extends down to load and unload cargo. To the front a door
leading to the cockpit can be seen, smaller racks on either side of it. @n
