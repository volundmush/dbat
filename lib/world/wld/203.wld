 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @YThit is the edge of the star that the planet Yardrat orbits. It is over
above average size, but still maintains average light and heat output. From
this distance most ships can withstand the heat produced by the star. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @mThis dark cloud of gas appears to only reflect light on the purple spectrum.
This gas boils and moves, manipulated by gravity and energy flowing through space
as well as its own chemical reactions. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @WThis large rock is floating through space free of any orbits. It is large
enough to have once been a small moon that may have escaped its orbit. There
seems to be a structure inside a crater on this side of the asteroid. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

@WDepths of Space@n~
 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n
