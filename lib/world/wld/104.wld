   @GThis small grassy island would be better classed as an outcrop, sticking up
out of the ocean which stretches as far as the eye can see. An alien looking
tree grows here in the middle of the island and there is a @Wskeleton@G leaning
against it's trunk. @n

note~
   @WIf someone finds this note, know that I was a student of Nail's. The
bastards told me to fly to Senzu village, but didn't show me how. So I swam
across the ocean but nearly drown. I tried to recuperate my energy on this
small outcrop but the supplies Guru gave me weren't sufficient. I'm going to
starve here. I pray you don't find the same fate. @n
