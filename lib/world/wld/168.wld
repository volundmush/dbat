   @rThis path winds through the large reddish black dunes of the Kemabra Wastes.
This path is made of a far lighter colored and finer textures sand than the rest
of the eastern waste. An acrid odor fills the air everytime the rough and
powerful winds shoot from the south across the wastes. It is due to this wind
that the dunes have piled up so high. The only thing keeping the sands from
completely covering this pathway with thier shifting masses is the large
bleached exoskeletons of gigantic dead insects. The surfaces of these
exoskeletons have been erroded by the winds and sand to the point where it is
impossible to tell at a glance what species they once belonged to. @n

The rough and powerful winds blowing in fromt he south continually shift the
sands around and pelt the surrounding area with debris. A terrible smell of
death fills the air and it appears that very few things can survive here for

   @DThe rough cliffs of the obsidian mountain seem to have been carved sometime
in the past to create an ascendable stair. This stair stretches up the side of
the mountain toward some prominant openings in the rock face about midway up
the mountain. At this altitude the wastes surrounding the mountain glitter in
the sunlight below. In the far distance to the west a rundown city can be seen
as a greyish brown smudge in an otherwise endless scene of wastelands that make
up Arlia. @n

   @DThis part of the mountain is high up enough where the already poor air
quality of planet Arlia has become worse. The smell of death hangs in the air
and the thin oxygen seems to have only added to this smell's unpleasant odor.
Loose chunks of obsidian have fallen loose from the cliffs above and smashed into
the floor of the cliffs in various areas. These impacts have either left small
craters in the cliff surface or furrows off the edge depending on the size of
the chunks. @n

have been assembled on it to serve as watchposts. A strange humming noise can
be heard coming from inside the cave to the north and dim lights can barely be
seen as well. @n

   @CThis area is the air right next to the mountain. The Kemabra Wastes can be
seen below and to the south west from here. Directly below obsidian rocks and
chunks of the mountain can be seen ready to assert gravity's judgement on those
bound to its force. @n

@RK@re@Dm@Wa@wbra W@Wa@Ds@rt@Res@D: @yBarren Gorge@n~
   @rThis is where the bottom of the wasteland dips down down through the nearby
obsidian rock. The sands of this area have mostly been swept clean towards the
north and west by the firece winds that frequent this region. Obsidian rocks
and stones litter the gorge bottom, fallen debris shaken loose from the
obsidian cliffs towering above. @n
