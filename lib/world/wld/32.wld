   @DThis appears to be the semi-dark entrance to a cave. Darkness can be seen to
the west obscuring the rest of the cave from view and a bright desert can be
seen to the east of here. The walls of this cave are unique from most as they
have a red color to them. @n

   @DThis dark area is close enough to the surface to have a steady supply of
fresh air. The walls, stalactites, and stalagmites all have a unique red color
to them. In this darkness seeing their details is difficult and what can be
seen appears to be flecks of some sort of red minerals found within the rock
surfaces. @n

   @DThis area is bathed in darkness and very little fresh air from the surface
has reached this far into the cave. The jagged stalactites and stalagmites are
larger here as well making travel difficult. The smell of this part of the cave
is rather damp and tinged with mold. Lastly the sounds of various winged

   @DThis wide part of the cave stretches out into darkness. Without walls to
reflect what little light has penetrated these depths the darkness is so thick
here that it appears absolute. There are fewer stalagmites and stalactites in
this area due to the distance between the floor and ceiling. The sounds of
winged creatures echo greatly in the wide expanse, creating a never ending
disturbance to the otherwise quiet cave. @n

   @DThis area is bathed in darkness and very little fresh air from the surface
has reached this far into the cave. The jagged stalactites and stalagmites are
larger here as well making travel difficult. The smell of this part of the cave
is rather damp and tinged with mold. Lastly the sounds of various winged
creatures can be heard echoing throughout the cave occasionally. @n

   @DThis part of the cave is almost a complete cliff leading down to the darkest
depths of the cave. Stagnant air is wafting up from the depths below. The
darkness below is as absolute as possible with no natural means of illumination.
The cliff face itself is potmarked from moisture damaging the walls sometime in
the past. @n

   @DThis part of the cave is incredibly dark with no natural light to be found at
all. The air is stagnant being that it is so far from the surface. There is
also a subtle yet strong odor of guano floating through the air. There is a
cliff face at the north side of this area leading up to the higher levels of the
