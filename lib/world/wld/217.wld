@rThe@n @YO@yu@Yt@yp@Yo@ys@yt@n : City Gate~
@nA colossal gate fit for the titans of legend stands to the north. No creases
can be seen, as if the gate entire was carved from the mountain itself. A
towering landscape of pillars and ramparts lie above the stone face of the
door. An unrecognizable set of runes in a lost language have been meticulously
etched into every side of the structure. If examined, the architecture begins
to to dwarf the mind with its sheer sense of size and solitude. @n

@rThe @YOutpost@n: Exposed Columns~
@nThere is no ceiling for these halls, leaving the walkway open to the elements.
Though the elements seem to have little to no effect on this ancient place. 
Pillars stretch to the skies casting shadows which loom over the path toward
their counterparts. Adjacent to the pillars, twelve foot tall statues in
various poses stand tall, gazing down upon those who pass through these
corridors. The sames runes that adorn the gate decorate the base of each
statue. @n

@rThe@Y Outpost@n: The Golden Dome@n~
@nA dome of amazing size covers a gargantuan platform. Three slim bridges
connect to the platform, a black void of space beneath them. Above, is a mural
that looks brand new and covers the ceiling of the domr. Painting of glorious
battles between all species are on display and they seem to radiate within this
room illuminating it with a strange light. Further examination of the art, the
painting scenes seem to move, replaying the battles like living memories in an
endless loop. In the center of the platform a single @YS@Wt@Ya@Wt@Yu@We@n can be seen. @n

@rThe@Y Outpost@n: Olympic Staircase~
@nStepping through a last pair of columns, the path leads to an opening. 
Through this opening lies a passage which is at first narrow but soon broadens
out as it reveals a grand staircase. The steps are far too tall and wide for
any normally-sized creature to traverse with any sort of ease. Torches of
white fire are staggered along the stairs, simply hovering in place as they
shed pale light eerily along the stairs and columns. The flames do not flicker
or waver, but remain always constant. @n

enormous, almost of impossible size. The walls are covered in shields with a

large hunks of meat placed on them. In the center look a giant roasting spit

@rThe@Y Outpost@n: The Forge@n~
@nThis room feels kind of small compared to the rest of the Outpost. A forge,
its circular base hot with fiery embers. Its chimney stack is built into the
wall allowing the smoke to pour out. The mouth of this forge is very large,
allowing the crafting of large-sized weapons. A large tank made of clay or
stone has been filled with water so one can cool the metal from the anvil. A
small amount of light leaks from the wall to the north, behind the forge. @n

@rThe@Y Outpost@n: Sanctum of the Gods@n~
@nThis room is barren of any design. It's an open roof room unlike most of the
Outpost. The floors are polished marble, a mix of colors white and black and a
large circular pillar sits in the middle of the room. It only reaches the
knees at its height, and it is decorated with @Yr@Wu@Yn@We@Ys@n that encirle it. The
entire room and pillar included, look as though they were carved from one piece
of marble; a single masterwork. No torches touch these walls, for all the
light needed comes from the opening of the roof. @n

@nAtop these monumental walls, you can see the entirety of the Outpost from up
here. One can see the Outer Sanctum and the enormous dome. From the
exccessively large long house, to white smoke rising from vents in the center
of the house. Large pillars topped with @Gg@Yr@Ge@Ye@Gn@n flames are staggered across the
top of the great wall. Runic carvings stretch across each pillar, and the sky
is decorated with wispy yellow clouds being torn to and fro by strong winds. 
The air is cold giving an almost frost-bitten feeling to those who linger in
one place for too long. @n

@rThe@Y Outpost@n: Battlements~
@nAtop these monumental walls, you can see the entirety of the Outpost from up
here. One can see the Outer Sanctum and the enormous dome. From the
exccessively large long house, to white smoke rising from vents in the center
of the house. Large pillars topped with @Gg@Yr@Ge@Ye@Gn@n flames are staggered across the
top of the great wall. Runic carvings stretch across each pillar, and the sky
is decorated with wispy yellow clouds being torn to and fro by strong winds. 
The air is cold giving an almost frost-bitten feeling to those who linger in
one place for too long. @n
