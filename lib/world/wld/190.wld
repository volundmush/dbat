wagon wheels in different locations, the cashier's station is made entirely out
of old wood, and even the cash register itself looks extremely old. The

   As you step into the shop you notice all sorts of high-tech equipment that
the Icers have aquired over the years. Ranging from weapons and armor, to odd
little things. The store itself is very clean, everything brightly shining
from being over polished. The air is filled with mutted beeps and other noises
from the display equipment thats running through various settings.

walk around and disturb things, filling the air with a musty smell. Shelves
and racks are pilled with old armor of various types, in different states of
condition. Some are so rusted, they look useless, while others look like they
could do with a good cleaning to look like new.

Large brownstone walls perimeter the entire area and stands at over fifteen
feet. A biometric scanner sits housed inside one of the columns of the wall,
waiting for someone to scan. Whoever resides here must be obsessed with

coordinated and obviously the result of a professional designer. A fireplace
against the north wall offers heat and light to the room and creating a
comforable, cozy aura. The aura is only slightly dampened by the sight of
camera lenses peeking out from various bricks in the fireplace in a checkered
pattern. The cameras are aligned so that no inch of the room isn't under

Mountaintop Fortress - Rocky Steps~
   A cascade of steps wind up the almost sheer cliff Western side of Cherry
Blossom mountain, formed into steep, tight knit switchbacks so as to make it
traversable. Each step looks to have been chiseled from the bare rock of the
ground, but is worn terribly with age and erosion, adding significantly to the
danger of the already treacherous climb. There are no Cherry blossom trees
here, or vegetation of any other sort aside from the occasional patch of yellow
grass or small shrub. At the end of the trail, built into the very cliff, is a
Gothic-style fortress made of rough carved black marble. The main building is
massive in proportions, bearing countless flying buttresses and stained glass
windows. Many statues line the walls of the building, though most are severely
damaged.

Mountaintop Fortress - Entrance Hall~
   The entrance hall is colossal, totaling in hight to over two-hundred feet.
Lining the walls on either side of the chamber, statues of warriors and kings
nearly reaching to the roof, many of them worn faceless by time and some even
shattered into pieces, dwarf any man in the hall with their stature and might.
At the very end of the hallway, a small blackwood throne rests on the cold
marble floor. Fastened in hinges along the wall, the torches intended to light
the room are burned all the way through and need to be replaced. As so, the
only light shining in the room is that of the long Gothic arched stained-glass
windows which shines a kaleidescope of warm colors on the room. A few of the
windows are broken and their glass remains scattered over the floor. Far above
you, the ceiling is vaulted and made of crumbling stone. In multiple places
sunlight shows through cracks and holes in the roof. To the west, a small
doorway leads to the stables. To the North, past the throne, a large archway
leads to the courtyard.

Mountaintop Fortress - Stables~
   The stables are small, little more than a wooden shack addition to the
entrance hall, and are made of thin boards of rotted wood. As the wind blows,
the building creaks and shudders wildly. In one of the horse stalls, the
fairly fresh carcass of a horse is strewn over the hay in a bloody mess with
flies gathering over it. Large black rats can be heard scratching at the
wooden floorboards and squeaking loudly as they move around the place. In one
of the stalls, a fairly clean pile of straw covered with simple woven blankets
can be seen.

Mountaintop Fortress - Courtyard~
   The Courtyard is an overgrown mess of weeds, surrounded on all sides by
other components of the castle that stare in on it with opened windows. Birds
can be heard chirping from their nest in a nearby Cherry Blossom tree and
squirrels climb through the wilderness. Shielded from the full brunt of
weathering while still able to receive enough sunlight, this courtyard seems to
have flourished where plant life elsewhere cannot. Stone pathways are barely
visible under fallen leaves and grass. In the center of the inlet, a stone
fountain that may have once spewed water remains idle, the water filling its
vine covered basin still and mirror like. The fountain looks to have once had
a statue in the center of it, but the work of stone has long since crumbled to
dust and is no longer recognizable.

Mountaintop Fortress - Dining Hall~
   The dining hall is a long room, but doesn't have an overwhelmingly high
ceiling in contrast to the Entrance Hall. At the far Northern end of the room,
a long horizontal table is elevated with seats positioned to face outward over
the hall. At the center of the table, an ornate red-velvet chair with an
exceedingly high back rests. Countless other tables occupy the room, facing
vertically and lower in hight than that of the nobles. Every seat at the
nobles table is set for a guest with silverware and porciline that, although
certainly regal looking, appears to be old and unpolished. The table is
covered in a thick layer of dust and the room smells overwhelmingly of rotten
fruit. To the south, a large entrance leads to the courtyard.

Mountaintop Fortress - Barracks~
   This room is quite rustic, looking almost like a museum with an impressive
assortment of medieval pole arms and maces on display along the wall, ever
ready to be picked up in the defense of the castle as they once had been. 
Along the walls, lines of simple wooden bunk beds mark the former sleeping
places of the fort's garrison, though they look to have been long since
abandoned, mattresses holed and torn by rodents and insects alike. The stairs
downwards lead to where a once well barricaded door had secured the dungeons
but now rested in shattered and warped pieces off of its hinges. Upwards, a
set of spiraling stairs leads to the walkway of the walls which now serves as a
landing pad to ships.

Mountaintop Fortress - Landing Pad~
   Catapults and trebuchets still remain at their posts atop the fortresses
walls, though they have long been out of repair and nonfunctional. Rather than
replacing these weapons, though, it seems the owner preferred to re-purpose the
area, instead creating a makeshift landing pad. Though it seems a lot of
effort went into clearing an adequate amount of room for a vessel, a master
pilot would be required to land a ship well on the uneven rubble of the wall.

In a few remote corners, devices of torture can be seen, such as stretchers and

dungeon is empty.

   The library rests in the bottom of the tower and is stock full of ancient
volumes. Rows upon rows of makeshift wooden bookcases, many of which toppled
over with their contents thrown across the floor, fill this level of the tower,
most reaching up to the thirty-foot tall roof and completely filled with books.
Closer examination, though, will yield that these books have been saturated
with water and where their ink didn't run to the point of illegibility or mold
grown over the pages, the mice have eaten through the books, destroying the
possibly useful information this library may have once had. A hatch in the
floor in the center of the room leads to the cellar below. Lining the wall, a
staircase spiraling with the walls of the tower leads up to the Baron's
chambers.

and unfaded tapestries of scarlet and lit by stand alone candles. There is a
single Gothic arch window that looks over Nexus City and a brass telescope,
entirely mechanical in function, is set up to facing the city through it. The
roof is a simple wooden frame supporting a garment of well knit together tile
pieces insulated with straw to keep in heat. Silken curtains of crimson drape
over a glorious, massive canopy bed that dominates the room. It appears to
have not been slept in for a time.

Mountaintop Fortress - Cistern~
   The air in this room is humid, far more than anywhere else in the estate,
due to the large collection of water here. The ceiling is held up by a low
stone vaulted ceiling supported by multiple elaborately carved columns. The
pools of water shine an eerie green color, and bubble in some places, revealing
it to be built on a hot spring. A few torches serve to adequately light the
area, though shadows shift rapidly as they flicker. On the far end of the
cistern, stacked in a messy pile on the ground above the waterline, are
countless kegs of mead, left to grow mold as they ferment further than is
healthy to drink. A few yards away from these kegs, a small barrel sits in
recluse, appearing to have been forgotten of in the cistern. Echoing through
the tight area, the squeaking of rats can be heard and the occasional splash as
one falls into the water.

Mountaintop Fortress - Secured Area~
   The walls of this area are whitewashed and made from a strange
synthetic-feeling material that is extremely smooth to the touch and light
seems to radiate from an unclear source. In the center of the room is a large
gravity generator, built into the rooms structure, but it seems to have a wide
variety of controls more than gravity. Upon fiddling with the controls some,
it can be discovered that the tiles that makeup the walls of the room are
actually screens that, when activated, show a whole variety of statistics and
security camera footage. To the east, a thickly barred Kachin door is sealed
shut. To the South, a massive laboratory can be seen.

   The labs, are made from the same material as the Secured Area, but are is
far more cluttered. Placed in close proximity to one another long steel tables
fill the room. Some are purely for analytical purposes, being stacked full of
technological computer equipment, while others serve as the storage places for
sickeningly long and thin needles as well as deadly sharp dissection knives and
other pointed equipment. Against the back wall, a storage facility contains
countless vials of labeled substances as they wait to be used for some sinister
purpose. A steel chair is drilled into the floor in the center of the room
with steel locks to secure a prisoner for something. Closer examination will
reveal that the chair reclines backwards to stretch a victim out horizontally
while still keeping them securely locked in place. The controls on the chair
are automated by motors and there appear to be a few more options than simply
adjusting it.

tank rests in front of it, but it also has an automated controls for
