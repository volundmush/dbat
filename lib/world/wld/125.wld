   @DThe air here is damp and cold, which does little more than compound the bleak
darkness that attempts to engulf this small area. At the back of the cave is a
pathway that seems to have been literally dug out of the mountain itself by some
sort of animal. It's only large enough for two people to fit through at a time.
A blue glow can be seen at the end of the it, shedding just enough light to see
here. @n

   @DOn closer inspection of this pathway, small, dull, crystals can be seen
protruding from the walls. The crystals themselves seem to have had chunks
bitten out of them at one time. @n

now providing enough room for a bus to fit safely. The air is actually a bit
warmer and dryer here than closer to the entrance. Every surface is covered in
light-blue @Ccrystals@D of varying shapes and sizes. @n

   @DUnnatural light begins to take over that of the @Ccrystals@D here. Voices begin
to mix with the thudding and cracking @Wsounds@D, however, they are rather
indistinct. The tunnel starts to narrow a ways down this path, a small doorway
becoming visible near the end. The unnatural light obviously comming from this
opening as a yellowish hue bathes everything near it. @n

   @DThis tunnel bends to the north a ways down it. Faint chittering noises can
be heard echoing here. The air in this area is actually a bit warmer and dryer
than closer to the entrance. Every surface is covered in light-blue @Ccrystals@D of
varying shapes and sizes. @n

   @DThe tunnel expands into a large room here, with the ceiling reaching heights
of twenty feet. The @Ccrystals@D lining the walls here have all been gnawed on,
losing their normal glow, while the larger ones on the ceiling are untouched. 
They hang down as large @Cstalactites@D, providing the only light here. Crushed
crystals have been piled all around, with unhatched eggs resting atop the piles
and broken shells scattered around them. Newly hatched Screamers can be seen
munching on the nests themselves while older ones scurry along the walls, eating
the crystals withing reach. @n

   @DThe ground suddenly takes a dive a few feet down this pathway. The angle of
the tunnel is somehow a perfect ninety degrees, with a pool of shimmering water
at the bottom. The temperature drops very rapidly here, even with the
light-blue @Ccrystals@D covering the walls. Distinct thuds can be heard
rhythmically rising from the drop off, with occasional odd @Wsounds@D mixing in. @n

@DThe small pool actually looks just deep enough to @njump@D into.@n

   @DUpon closer inspection, the pool that makes up the majority of this room, is
in fact only shimmering due to the @Ccrystals@D that make up the walls here. The
pool is completely still and crystal clear. Pure white fish can be seen
darting about in the three foot deep water. The room itself isn't quite large,
only spanning about twelve feet in circumference. The @Wsounds@D that could barely
be heard above, now echo loudly off every surface. The thudding noises more
distinct, and metallic. @n

   @DThis entire area is one giant excavation pit. Scaffolding lines every
tier-like ledge in this massive room. Slavers can be seen, cracking whips at
slaves and beating them in an attempt to make them work faster. Hundreds of
slaves fill the three tiers of this site, working furiously to mine @Ccrystals@D
from the surrounding mountain. Large lights, powered by wires running in
complex and twisted layouts, beam bright spotlights on all of the pit, causing
this area to be in perpetual daylight. @n

   @DThis entire area is one giant excavation pit. Scaffolding lines every
tier-like ledge in this massive room. Slavers can be seen, cracking whips at
slaves and beating them in an attempt to make them work faster. Hundreds of
slaves fill the three tiers of this site, working furiously to mine @Ccrystals@D
from the surrounding mountain. Large lights, powered by wires running in
complex and twisted layouts, beam bright spotlights on all of the pit, causing
this area to be in perpetual daylight. @n

   @DThis is the center of the entire site. The area is actually quite small,
only being about 200 square feet. Unlike the rest of the site, no slaves are
seen here except the occasional cart pusher disappearing within the tunnel to
the north. This whole area is devoid of crystals, dirt and rock making up its
walls and floor. Every now and then, small chunks of debris fall from the
working slaves above. @n

   @DThis tunnel appeared to lead somewhere further in the mine but a cave in has
closed off travel to the north. The Large boulders making up the wall appear
to be in a load bearing position, and if they were moved, the tunnel might
collapse further. @n

   @DThis ramp is made of some sort of hardwood and connects tier three with tier
two. Despite being made of thick materials, the ramp seems to bow and creak
with each step. Every now and then, slaves can be seen running up and down it,
pushing large carts full of the glowing crystals, nets preventing them from
spilling. @n
