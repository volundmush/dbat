owners~
An massive oil painting of Byou is hung here, with a fierce look upon his face and the strength to back it up, they definitely look like someone you don't wish to cross.
Another oil painting can be seen adjacent to that one nearly equal it the other in size, it appears to be the current owner, Lordling Kouhyou. Standing there in their suppressed form as they have a calm and calculated look written across their face.

establishment~
The establishment is around 20 acres in it's overall size barred off by a metal gate. A nice garden with various greens can be seen here as well, in the middle of it all on the way to the mansion-like building, is a circular fountain with the design of some type of aquatic life native to the Frigid.

Estate - Lounge~
@cThis large and extravagant rooms is just one of many within the Estate of Byou. Decorated with fine lounge chairs, exquisite animal skin rugs, a crystal-like chandelier, and a crystal table that gleams with each sunray that radiates onto it.

Estate Guest Room - Nyx's Room~
@DContrary to the rest of the estate, this room once elegant and lavish, look rather gothic yet somehow still retains some form of grace. The curtain have been closed to prevent any sunlight from appearing in the room, and most of the lights within the room itself are either off or very dim. In one corner of the room is an @GElzthuan Tarantula@D rests here with a collar around its neck. Following from that corner of the room there is a dresser with different sorts of swords and daggers either propped up against it or on top of it. In the middle of the room is a large bed, with dark green sheets and various shades of green surrounding it.

Elzthuan Tarantula~
This apex predator of the Elzthuan Forest is rather terrifying, it's body looks like that of a black widow that is over grown. Standing at around five feet tall, this tarantula secretes vemon from its mouth that it uses to paralysis its prey. This one has a @gemerald green@n shock collar around its neck and it seems to be tame?

Estate - Empty Guest Room~
@cThis room is fairly empty, save for the standard furnishing that a standard guest room would contain. A large bed takes up a good portion of the space in the room and a desk sits unadorned by items. A dresser is on the left of the bed should any guest need to put their spare clothes somewhere, and a nightstand is on the opposing side of the bed for loose small items to rest on its surface.@n

Estate - Training Room~
@cThis room is filled with all sorts of training equipment for servants, guest, and of course the house owners to improve in if need be. The room is spacious enough to allow each group of people who train in here to branch off and train unabided. A gravity chamber is stationed in the center of the room controlling the level of gravity for the entire room. The far north of the room has the healing tank stationed there.@n
