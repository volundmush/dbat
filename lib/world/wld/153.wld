@DDark @bUnderwater @cCave@W: @wEntrance@n~
   @bThis small area appears to be a cave carved out sometime in the past. 
Sharp jagged rocks stand up near the edges of the entrance mimicing the
appearance of some sort of beast's mouth. There is practically no light in the
cave to be found except by glowing plants and fish that make their home inside.
The rock walls of the cave have a green appearance due to the species of glowing
plants found within. @n

   @bThis part of the cave appears to be a gap between an ever winding channel of
smooth rock. The only light to be found in this area comes from the species of
glowing plants and fish. It's this light that gives the surrounding rock a
greenish tint. @n

   @bThe cave comes to a complete dead end here. Rocky crags and debris fill all
but the direction to the west and prevent any further passage through the cave.
It's possible that a past cavein created this situation or it's possible that
the cave always ended here.

   @BThis appears to be the entrance to a dark underwater cave. The water
flowing out of this cave is far colder than any of the surrounding water. 
Abnormal chunks of ice can be seen on the rock walls of the cave from here. 
Ghostly blue flames seem to wink on and off from somewhere deep in the cave. @n

   @cThis appears to be the entrance hall of an ancient temple of some sort. 
Twin statues of naked female kanassans adorn the door posts to either side and
stand about fifteen feet high with their hands stretched out to hold up the
ceiling. The left arm and side of the left one's torso have crumbled away
sometime in the past. Giant emeralds have been set firmly into each of their
eye sockets. The nearby marble walls are covered in cracks and crevices and
water from the nearby ocean has completely filled the visible interior of the
temple. @n

   @cThis expansive room appears to have served as a sanctum or ritual chamber of
the temple in the past. Chunks of the ceiling have broken off in places and
fallen to the floor below. A large emerald encrusted piller rises up in the
center of the sanctum and what little light that can be found in the room
reflects off it in a shimmering pattern onto all the room's walls. @n
