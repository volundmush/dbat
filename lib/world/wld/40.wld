   This level of Ice Crown is known as the Merchants district and is where the
majority of shops and services in the city can be located.  The streets bustle
with activity as mutants, icers and many more push and shove their way through
the crowded streets to get to their next destination.  Derek the Dodo is walking
around here advertising Amnu-nation, which is just to the west.

   Shanty houses and regular domociles stand side by side, lining the streets
here in the lower level of Ice Crown City.  It is the primary residential
district of the city and indeed the entire planet.  Some sections of this level
are dim or even dark due to poor maintenance of the complex lights, meaning
these parts have become notorious for thieves and other criminals.

   Shanty houses and regular domociles stand side by side, lining the streets
here in the lower level of Ice Crown City.  It is the primary residential
district of the city and indeed the entire planet.  Some sections of this level
are dim or even dark due to poor maintenance of the complex lights, meaning
these parts have become notorious for thieves and other criminals.
