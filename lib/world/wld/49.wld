   This path leads up and down the extinct volcano known as Ice Crown.  It's
surface is made up of rough gravel but appears reasonably well looked after, as
the snow present on either side of the path is shoveled quite regularly should
any of the white powder be found on the path.  A large cavern-like door is to
the south, leading to the lower level of Ice Crown City.

road that splits both of them and even further still, a small settlement.

   This highway is only has two lanes but is quite busy considering the climate
of the planet.  It links the major settlements of Frigid together and passes
through the Topica Snowfields and the Acturian Woods.  There are small insulated
huts every couple of miles along the highway which serve as shelter for drivers
whom happen to be out when a blizzard hits.

   This highway is only has two lanes but is quite busy considering the climate
of the planet.  It links the major settlements of Frigid together and passes
through the Topica Snowfields and the Acturian Woods.  There are small insulated
huts every couple of miles along the highway which serve as shelter for drivers
whom happen to be out when a blizzard hits.
