@WTo play blackjack you must have at least 5 zenni. You can bet up to 25 when you say deal(ie. "deal 25"). 5 is the minimum bet though. If you have a hand value of 12 or less you will be allowed to raise up to 25 zenni more(50 total).@n
 
-How to play-
@Gsay deal@n : This deals you your first two cards.
@Gsay raise@n: This raises your bet to 25 zenni.
@Gsay hit@n  : This gives you another card.
@Gsay fold@n : This allows you to quit a hand instead of playing it.
@Gsay stand@n: This has you stay with the cards you have and you compete against the dealer's cards.
@Ghand@n     : This shows you your hand, it is a command not spoken.
 
@RWARNING@W Basic knowledge of blackjack is required if you don't want to lose your money a lot.@n

@WS@Ci@wl@Wv@Ce@wr @DM@Wi@nne: Entrance~
   @WThis area is mostly filled in with gravel and seems to get a lot of heavy
vehicle movement. A large black hole leading into the side of a massive hill
can be seen to the north. The hole has steel support beams maintaining its
stability around the edges. Lights can be seen hanging from the mine ceiling
through the entrance. @n

A @Gsign@n has been posted here.
