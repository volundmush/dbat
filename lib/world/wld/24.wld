   @cThis marble area is chock full of mass produced and uncomfortable looking
bunk beds. Foot lockers have been placed at the ends of each bunkbed allowing
for the warriors stationed in this barracks to store their things in the
lockers. Very little natural light or fresh air manages to enter the room
through slit like windows along the ceiling. As a result the smell of body odor
and sweat fills the air. @n

cots placed behind a short wall. This is where the royal guards sleep in shifts
when protecting either King or Prince Vegeta. An alarm system has been built
into the room so that if any of the guards die the entire palace is alerted. @n

   @cThis richly decorated room is huge. Almost large enough to fit a small house
in the center of its floor. Its ceiling reaches up about thirty feet and is
shaped into a dome. The dome part of the ceiling is covered in gold in the
shape of the royal crest, that of a star. From the center of the dome an
emerald chandelier hangs down, providing light for the entire room. @n

   @WThis small office is where the administration of the Amnu-Nation Weapon Club
is handled. An oak desk sits in the middle of the room, with a lot of
scattered paper work on top of it. Aside from a few planets and a waste bin,
there doesn't seem to be much else here. @n
