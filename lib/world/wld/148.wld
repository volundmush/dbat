   @WThis expansive foyer is the entrance to the Akatsuki Labs facility. In the
very middle of the white marble floor is a swan fountain, crystalline water
flowing over the swan centerpiece in a constant stream. A receptionist's desk
has been placed on the northern side of the room, near a well secured door. 
Behind the desk is a large LCD screen displaying the Akatsuki @Rlogo@W. @n

   @gA variety of weapons appear to be constructed in this lab, as weapons in
different stages of their completion can be found scattered across cold steel
benches along with many parts that make them up. Tools of the trade can also be
found to assist scientific research. @n

Dispensible targets drop down from the ceiling closer to the western wall, to
give hand selected soldiers something to fire upon. There is a @Rsign@g on the

   @gThis expansive lab seems rather empty in terms of equipment compared to most
other labs in the Akatsuki facility. A large tube can be found in the middle of
the room, that reaches from the floor to the ceiling. Black cabling is sprawled
out across the floor leading from the tube to several points in the walls. The
occasional crackling of electricity can be heard coming from these cables. 
There is also a terminal present near the tube. @n

   @gNear the entrance to the lab, is a large terminal which is connected to a
bio-pod in the center of the room, via black cables. An eery green glow lights
up the lab and is coming from the pod. Soothing music can be heard coming from
speakers positioned in the corners. @n
