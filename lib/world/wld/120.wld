 This area is full of the mix of people entering the spaceport and the noise
from the ships can be heard upon entering the area.  The amount of activity here
draws the attention and looking ahead a large seating area is ahead where people
wait for their ship.

 Upon entering the lobby the noise substantially increases compared to the
entrance area.  This area is larger than what appears at first especially with
the large screens positioned everywhere to ensure people see the arrival and
departure times of the ships.

 A rather large stone launchpad is here where older spaceships dock for those
who have purchased a public ticket.  A little run down the ships can still carry
plenty of people safely to their destination with no worries.

   @GTo the east, Aether City can be seen. The peaceful activity of the city
makes for a serene scene, gently flowing around and to the west as if the
tranquility of the combat meadow were somehow connected to Aether City itself.
Even the sounds of combat from the west seem somewhat muted, as if the combat
were only halfhazard and not performed with intent to kill. @n

   @GLush, green grass carpets the flat ground here, softening the footfalls of
anyone who treads within this meadow. On the outskirts of the meadow to the
north and south, Kais and other students of Kibito can be seen training. Some
meditate, focusing on the abilities of the mind. Others seem to be sparring to
focus on the abilities of the body. Yet, even still, there is a peaceful and
tranquil quality to the meadow. @n

   @gThick blades of grass have been meticulously woven together into the large
mat that spans the entirety of the floor here. The mat feels soft enough to
prevent serious injury from colliding with the ground, and appears to be capable
of withstanding a good deal of punishment. The walls of the dojo are an earthy
brown, a few sections are padded with grass panels. Large pillars formed from
the core of some massive tree are spread about the dojo, holding up the ceiling
overhead and removing the need for additional walls, so the majority of the dojo
is left wide open.

@YSurvival Tips with Bartholomew Blackstone, 
Adventurer Extraordinaire!@n
@g-----------------------------------------------@n

@WSurviving in the wilderness can be tough! Nights 
can be cold, and without any light, you're at the
mercy of the creatures that can see in the dark! 
Not to fear, though, for good ol' Bart Blackstone 
is here to help!

@WMake sure to get plenty of wood! Without the 
proper kiln dried logs, you may have trouble 
keeping a fire that will last.

@WYou'll need at least @w3 quartered logs@W built in 
a pyramid to make a fire. With a little bitta elbow 
grease and some patience, soon your fire will be 
roaring like a lion!

@WYoull also find that laying next to a fire is quite 
relaxing, and it often gets me feeling energetic
and ready for the next adventure!@n

@g-----------------------------------------------@n
@YThis has been survival tips with Bartholomew 
Blackstone! Be safe, and good luck out there!@n

   There are several mannequins standing around this shop, fully clothed in the
sort of armor this shop sells. The stock must be kept in a back room however,
as there are only clothing items in the store. Pinned up on the walls are
various posters of warriors dodging attacks while wearing armor exclusive to
this shop. On the northern wall a sign reads 'Nimble Dodgings'.

the healing pools. Warriors visiting the dojo can use this chamber to rest and

   @gThick blades of grass have been meticulously woven together into the large
mat that spans the entirety of the floor here. The mat feels soft enough to
prevent serious injury from colliding with the ground, and appears to be capable
of withstanding a good deal of punishment. The walls of the dojo are an earthy
brown, a few sections are padded with grass panels. Large pillars formed from
the core of some massive tree are spread about the dojo, holding up the ceiling
overhead and removing the need for additional walls, so the majority of the dojo
is left wide open. Unlike the rest the dojo, the ground here is marred with
brownish-black burn spots and parts of the pillars that support the ceiling have
splintered dents across their surface.

the shop, detailed in such a way as to look like free-flowing water from a
distance. Four evenly spaced, stout sticks of bamboo looking wood curve upward
to tapering tips with leaves to give them a palm tree feel. A banner reading
'Healthy Choice' hangs between the two most northerly artificial trees.

the tiled floor, buffing out any scuffs in its path. Several automated teller

armor available on Aether. On the western wall is a sign that appears to brag
about how they have supplied armor to the Supreme Kais for several generations
now. On the eastern wall hangs the various pieces of armor one can buy, while
some also are hung up on the southern wall behind the counter. Two mannequins,
one male and one female, are in the middle of the store showing off the complete
set of which has subtle differences between the genders. @n

into the sky. Either side of the footpath leading through the park are round
braziers, not only lighting the way at night but are symbols of hope. The
flames are magical, having burned since the first time the braziers were lit. 
Trees with flowers of pink, white and red are further back off the path and make
up the rest of the park. @n

   @WIn the very center of Harmony Park, a large statue of a Supreme Kai rises up
into the sky. Either side of the footpath leading through the park are round
braziers, not only lighting the way at night but are symbols of hope. The
flames are magical, having burned since the first time the braziers were lit. 
Trees with flowers of pink, white and red are further back off the path and make
up the rest of the park. @n
