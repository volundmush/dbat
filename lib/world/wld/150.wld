any wood is rare in the city. Various patrons can be seen sitting at these

the kitchen and at the counter of that window is where orders are made. @n

@YSurvival Tips with Bartholomew Blackstone, 
Adventurer Extraordinaire!@n
@g-----------------------------------------------@n

@WSurviving in the wilderness can be tough! Nights 
can be cold, and without any light, you're at the
mercy of the creatures that can see in the dark! 
Not to fear, though, for good ol' Bart Blackstone 
is here to help!

@WMake sure to get plenty of wood! Without the 
proper kiln dried logs, you may have trouble 
keeping a fire that will last.

@WYou'll need at least @w3 quartered logs@W built in 
a pyramid to make a fire. With a little bitta elbow 
grease and some patience, soon your fire will be 
roaring like a lion!

@WYoull also find that laying next to a fire is quite 
relaxing, and it often gets me feeling energetic
and ready for the next adventure!@n

@g-----------------------------------------------@n
@YThis has been survival tips with Bartholomew 
Blackstone! Be safe, and good luck out there!@n

meets the western wall a large recess has further been cut out of the rock. 
Large rock columns support the ceiling of this section that has been cut out.
Each column standing about twenty feet from floor to ceiling. Past the columns
large silver lined wood doors leading into the temple can be seen. @n

   @CThis wide spacious hall appears to be the main attraction of the temple. 
It is made up like the rest of the temple except that its ceiling is twice as
high up. Halfway up its walls a walkway for the second floor can be seen. 
Toward the center of the first floor part of the hall a large pool of water can
be seen taking up the entire grounds of the hall. In the center of this pool
is a statue of a female kanassan that reaches all the way up to the ceiling. @n

   @WThis wide room appears to have been used to store things in the past. Its
dark walls and floor are mostly bare now though. Signs of movement can be seen
all along it though and it appears that the room is mostly used for meetings
now. @n

seen in the center of the room. A large confy shark-skin chair can be seen
behind it. Hanging from the ceiling can be seen a large white lamp. @n

@mD@Ma@Wr@wk @mC@Me@Wl@wl@ma@Mr@D: @WExtravagantly Decorated Room@n~
   @WThis room which was converted from a storage area of the celler has been
decorated with all kinds of expensive furniture and objects. A large bed
framed out of gold sits in the center of the room. This appears to be the
bedroom of someone particularly important. @n

@mD@Ma@Wr@wk @mC@Me@Wl@wl@ma@Mr@D: @WWide Hallway@n~
   @WThis hallway has been lined with various strong metals. Built into the
hallway every dozen feet are gates which currently sit open. Presumably during
a crisis these gates shut, sealing off intruders from reaching those beyond the
gates. @n

@mD@Ma@Wr@wk @mC@Me@Wl@wl@ma@Mr@D: @WLarge Office@n~
   @WThis office is decorated almost entirely in fine exotic wood. To a resident
of Aquis City this room's wood is a treasure trove of indescribable riches. 
The most marvelous aspect of the room appears to be a large mohagany desk
toward the south wall of the large room. A large cushoined chair sits behind
the desk and several smaller chairs have been lined up in front of it. @n

@cA@Cq@Wu@bi@Bs @DC@Wi@wt@Wy@D: @cEast Entrance@n~
   @cThis large area is almost entirely made of metal. The metal walls, ceiling,
and floor all converge toward a large opening. The opening however is not
covered with metal. It's covered with some kind of gooey substance in the form
of a wall. This wall works as a perfect barrier for the water outside. 
People however can freely enter and leave the barrier because of its built in
adaption to not hinder humanoid movement. @n
