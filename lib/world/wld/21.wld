   @WVR Megaman is a game of TAG. The point if to be not "it" the longest. The
longer you remained untagged, the more points you get. However if you are it
you lose points the longer you are it. So the goal is to avoid being it
whenever possible.

   @WVR Mario is a game of points! You collect points in certain ways. 
Depending on how you do something you may get more points. For example you get
points for stomping an enemy, but you get more points by sending a Koopa Troopa
sliding into a bunch of enemies in a row. You also get points for bashing coin
boxes or grabbing the ultra rare flag. The point is to be the one with the most
points by the end of the game which is done by setting up the best point
gathering combos.

   @WVR Zelda is a game of combat and collection. The goal is to be the one with
the highest amount of rupees by the time the game ends. You gain rupees by
killing enemies with your magical sword, throwing a boomerang wich will stun a
player in the game other than the thrower and cause them to drop rupees, or a
bomb which will hit everyone in a room except the thrower. Players can fight
other players with their swords as well. With each player getting 3 hearts per
spawn. If a player is killed the one who killed them will get 25% of the rupees
the loser had.

   @WWelcome to VR World! How this works is there are three VR games available to
load. They are multiplayer games, so invite all your friends to play! To read
the rules of a particular game type 'look' and the name of the game. The basic
game start/entry commands are listed below here.


   There needs to be at least three players by the time the game ends for there
to be any winners(first and second places). It costs 50 zenni to enter a game,
so make sure you have the money. 


   To view the games available just type load. It is strongly suggested you
read the game's rules before attempting to play. 

@Gload
load (game name)
enter game
gtime@n

   @ROnce a game is started, it will continue until finished. It is intended for
several people to play, so do not enter solo. @n
