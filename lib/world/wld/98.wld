   @cThe water has a healthy pale blue sheen to it, though a variety of weeds and
upturned mud from the floor of the lake prevent it from achieving a crystal
clear transparency. Instead the murkiness seems to hide a variety of fish and
other creatures, as shadows ranging from the size of tiny minnows to
unbelievable enormity can be seen sliding about. While the landscape seems
serene enough, the lake water itself is in a constant state of choppiness, as if
there was a continual turbulence hidden just below the surface. Larged scaled
bodies can be spotted sliding briefly above the surface, and will occasionally
carry with it a soft growling hiss, a larger and more ominous version of the
sounds that could be found in the swamp that is connected to the lake somewhere
along the western edge. @n

   @WThe shore is a clean mix of sand and rock that spreads out, continuing to
gradually slope upwards and away off into the distance, suggesting that the lake
was once a much larger body of water. Along the edge of the water, small shards
of shells and bones can be seen scattered among the rocks, along with the
occasionaly bloodstained chunk of flesh that has been pushed up by the constant
churning of the chops. @n

   @cThe water has a healthy pale blue sheen to it, though a variety of weeds and
upturned mud from the floor of the lake prevent it from achieving a crystal
clear transparency. Instead the murkiness seems to hide a variety of fish and
other creatures, as shadows ranging from the size of tiny minnows to
unbelievable enormity can be seen sliding about. While the landscape seems
serene enough, the lake water itself is in a constant state of choppiness, as if
there was a continual turbulence hidden just below the surface. Larged scaled
bodies can be spotted sliding briefly above the surface, and will occasionally
carry with it a soft growling hiss, a larger and more ominous version of the
sounds that could be found in the swamp that is connected to the lake somewhere
along the western edge. @n

gradually slope upwards and away off into the distance, suggesting that the lake
was once a much larger body of water. Along the edge of the water, small shards
of shells and bones can be seen scattered among the rocks, along with the

   @WShaeras Mansion has been the home of many of House Sereg-Vanma's high ranking
members over the years. It also serves as the headquarters for the House. A
large black banner hangs from the roof, with the red symbol of Sereg-Vanma
imprinted into it. There are several desks around this lobby, each with a
Konatsu in attendance. @n

end. The hallway seems to get no natural light and is quite dark, the only
light source is from carefully positioned candles that give off a red glow. @n

House Sereg-Vanma. An obsidian chandilier hangs from the ceiling, filled with
the red candles found present elsewhere in the Mansion. The bed is covered in a
black sheet with the symbol of the House imprinted on it. @n

A large boiler like machine is at the back of the room, rumbling loudly. One of

   @WDespite the somewhat suspect name of this store, the Konatsu behind the
counter appears to take great pride in the Sereg-Vanma ties and the store
itself is immaculately well-kept. Daggers and dirks of all varieties hang from
weapon racks, but no other style of weapon can be seen. @n
