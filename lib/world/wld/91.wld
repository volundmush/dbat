@RE@WD@CF@W Headquarters@n~
   @RE@WD@CF@n headquarters is a technologically advanced room, where fighters of
varying strengths come to apply and work for the @RE@narth @WD@nefense @CF@norce. Two
guards stand by the front door, and two more by the front desk, all of which
look quite powerful. Light filters into the room from unindentifiable sources,
but despite not being able to tell from where the light comes, the room is well
lit. There are no windows to the outside, as the entire building seems built
to withstand explosions of terrible force. @n

@RE@WD@CF@W Novice Shop@n~
   @nThe @RE@WD@CF@W Novice Shop@n is a room with an assortment of neat but not terribly
fancy objects for sale. Most are displayed on the walls around the room, but a
few items are kept in a glass case that also serves as a counter where the
clerk stands ready to help customers.

@RE@WD@CF@W Novice Recreation Room@n~
   Pool tables, arcade games, a large assortment of seating areas, and a small
set of tables at which one might sit and have a meal, play card games with
friends, or just discuss life adorn this room. Guards pass into and out of
this room frequently, making certain that order is kept should anyone grow a
little rowdy at the loss of a game or antagonization of a conversation.

@DS@w@yh@wadow@Dr@wai@Dn C@wit@Dy@w - @RShadowrain Highway@n~
   Shadowrain Highway leads to and from Shadowrain. A huge spire to the west
can be seen, and far above it some kind of structure. To the east, hints of
the city of Shadowrain can be seen. This road is well kept, and the grass
within ten feet of the highway is newly mowed and clearly recently maintained.

@DS@w@yh@wadow@Dr@wai@Dn C@wit@Dy@w - @RJail Room@n~
   This room is to hold people under suspicion of rule breaking, or whose
evidence is being presented to a higher imm to get a decision on what
punishment should be. If you're here, there's probably significant evidence
against you, so please don't make things worse for yourself.

   @WThe central square of @DS@yh@wadow@Dr@wai@Dn@W is paved with @wgrey@W and @Dblack@W brick,

@RS@Wedd@Ry's O@Wffic@Re@n~
Seddy's office is full of test tubes, bunson burners, toothpicks, dental floss,
and an extreme amount of duct tape. Apparently, these are the things he builds
with. This seems somewhat odd, but then again... It's Seddy.
