   @WThe usual lush @Ggreen@W grass of planet @GN@ga@Gm@ge@Gk@W's plains have been stomped down
by the feet of dozens of @Rs@ro@Wl@nd@Di@We@rr@Rs@W, now @Yb@yrownin@Yg@W and dying. Otherwise, there is
little to no vegetation. Small makeshift huts have been built for the @Rs@ro@Wl@nd@Di@We@rr@Rs@W
of @CF@cr@We@ni@cz@Ca@W's army to stay in while they are there. @rF@Ri@Yr@Re@rs@W can be seen strewn
throughout the camp, in front of the various tents and small buildings. The
construction seems to have been very recent, as if they were not there for
long, and did not plan to be. The very center of the encampment has a large
tent, probably for the lead officer. @n

having been put up hastily. The materials used to make it seemed to have come
from the surrounding area, made entirely of stone, dried mud, and dead grass.
The general sound of @Rs@ro@Wl@nd@Di@We@rr@Rs@W and day-to-day life in a camp can be faintly
heard echoing over the wall. @n

   @WThe usual lush @Ggreen@W grass of planet @GN@ga@Gm@ge@Gk@W's plains have been stomped down
by the feet of dozens of @Rs@ro@Wl@nd@Di@We@rr@Rs@W, now @Yb@yrownin@Yg@W and dying. Otherwise, there is
little to no vegetation. Small makeshift huts have been built for the @Rs@ro@Wl@nd@Di@We@rr@Rs@W
of @CF@cr@We@ni@cz@Ca@W's army to stay in while they are there. @rF@Ri@Yr@Re@rs@W can be seen strewn
throughout the camp, in front of the various tents and small buildings. The
construction seems to have been very recent, as if they were not there for
long, and did not plan to be. The very center of the encampment has a large
tent, probably for the lead officer. @n

having been put up hastily. The materials used to make it seemed to have come
from the surrounding area, made entirely of stone, dried mud, and dead grass.
The general sound of @Rs@ro@Wl@nd@Di@We@rr@Rs@W and day-to-day life in a camp can be faintly

   @BThe oceans of Namek are wide and expansive, covering the majority of the

   @GWhile there is little vegetation itself to speak of, the landmasses of Namek

gently sloping hills and steep outcrops. The landmass here meets the ocean, as
the water gently laps it's edges. @n
