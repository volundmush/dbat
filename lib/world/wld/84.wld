 @GA massive tree stands proudly here in what is presumed to be the middle of
the forest.  Legend has it this tree is the heart of the forest and was the
first tree to grow in this region.  Strange markings have been carved into the
trunk near the base of the tree.  It looks climbable.  @n

   @GThe branches at this level of the tree are so hhigh that they tower in height
over the entire forest, allowing anyone brave enough to climb this igh, to get a
great view of the forest landscape below. Among the branches, walkways and
small platforms appear to have been constructed. It may be possible to climb
down the tree here. @n

   @GHigh above the ground, platforms and pathways have been constructed among the
thick branches of the giant tree in the center of the Elzthuan Forest. The

 @GThis small hut was built high up in the forest canopy to serve as a resting
place for hunters as they hunted the various forest creatures.  Whenever a
hunter leaves the hut, they are obligated to leave behind resources for the next
hunter to take up residence here.  The hut itself is plainly ordorned and made
out of thin sheets of wood.  @n

@YM@ya@Wz@wo@yr@Yi @yFa@Dr@Wm@n - Paddock~
 The paddock area of the Mazori's farm is a reflection of the Mazori family
luck and fortune.  This region of the Dres District has been in an almost
constant drought for years.  The fences surrounding the paddock are broken or
loose in places and the paddock itself only has several patches of grass, the
rest slowly degenerating into a dirt field.

 This stone brick well used to be full of water all year round until the
Mazori Family bought this farm.  Ever since drought has ravaged this particular
region and the well has all but dried up.  A rickety ladder leads down into the
well.

 The Mazori farmhouse is quite run down like the rest of the farm.  This is
the living room of the old farmhouse, the only part that is accessible.  There
are several sleeping bags on the floor.  There is a small shrine on a bench
against the eastern wall that has been well looked after.  It contains the most
valuable belongings of the Mazori Family.  The several windows in this room are
covered in cobwebs.

connect the roof to the floor.  There are numerous holes in the walls and roofs
