   @WThis narrow gravel road looks like it hasn't been renewed in quite some
time. It runs through a mixture of hills and grassland near the northern
mountain range. Cherry Blossom Mountain can be seen a good ways to the north
east looming over the entire area. The road seems to wrap around towards Nexus
Field to the north of Nexus City. To the south Shadow Forest can be seen, with
murky mists rising up from all its vegetation. @n

 @WThe gravel road leads right up to a decrepit building that appears to be some
sort of old garage slash gas station.  The pumps have been removed and there
only appears to be one entrance.  There is a single light bulb lit above the
entrance, hanging by its own cable.  @n

testing labs is performed.  Steel tables with heavy duty equipment have been
placed all around the wide expansive room.  Adjustable lights, computer
monitors, and scanning equipment have been placed above or by each table.  On
some of the tables half constructed androids can be seen, some as little

 @WThis concrete stairwell has no decorations and very little light.  The steps
have a single steel rail running down the center of the stairs.  The stairs
themselves do not drop that far, seemingly only a single floor in distance.  A

 @WThis well lit hallway has titanium tiles bolted to the floor.  The walls and
ceiling appear to be made of some form of reinforced concrete.  White lights
illuminate the entire hallway from above, and occasionally red alert lights can
be seen bolted to sections of the wall.  @n

 @WThis plain concrete room doesn't look as if its owner cares much for
decorations.  Dull white lights illuminate several bookcases lined up near the
entrance to the room.  Beyond those bookcases a study area and sleeping area can
be seen with plain brown carpeting covering the floor in those two areas.  @n

 @WHalf of this large room is filled with rows of bookshelves that reach nearly
to the nine foot tall ceiling.  The other side of this concrete room a steel
desk with many different computer monitors located on it can be seen.  On a
clear spot of the desk blueprints and diagrams of android models can be seen.  @n
