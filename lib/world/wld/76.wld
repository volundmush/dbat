   This deep cavern is flooded with water. Little to no light in available,
and as you make your way further in it only gets worse. The walls of the
tunnel are unworked or raw, closing tightly in some areas then expanding
allowing maybe two people to stand shoulder to shoulder.

Tunnel Exit~
   The water in the slowly declines as the tunnel goes upward, eventually
leveling off to about ankle deep water. As you slosh your way through, it
suddenly becomes apparent that there are steps leading to above, and a brighter
light trickles through the hole in the ceiling. The smell of dampness and life
hangs heavy in the air.

leaks in through waterfalls. The ground is covered by dead and decaying

Lost City: Shallow Bridge~
   This old stone path is covered with about a foot of water. Algae is growing
on the walls right around the holes where the water seeps out before it pools
onto the floor. Some stones are somewhat uprooted and slightly out of pass. 
If one wasnt careful they might fall face first.

Lost City: Shallow Bridge~
   This old stone path is covered with about a foot of water. There are no
walls here, instead water expands to both the left and the right. Water is
pooling in off in the distance causing a waterfall sound to fill the area. 
Its almost surreal if everything wasnt in ruins.

Lost City: Inner Circle~
   The area feels desolate leaving little to no thought about there being life
here. What looks like a once great civilization has been reduced to rubble. 
The ruins stand tall however, some of the old buildings in better conditions
than others. The stone that was used to erect these building seems like it
could have come from the mountain walls that the ruins were residing in. The
only true enemy of these once greatly crafted buildings is time.

Large holes in the walls spew water out at fairly alarming rate, though the
water level doesnt seem to rise. The holes are evenly spaced and look as if

Behind the Waterfall~
   Save A small cave can be found behind the roaring waterfall. The walls,
floor, and ceiling have been smoothed away by the wetness that covers it. 
There is evidence of animals having lived here, but in the center at the far
back a single rock can be found, oddly placed.
