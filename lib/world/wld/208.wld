 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @YThis bright yellow star is of average size. At this distance the heat from
the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so
intense that looking at it with unprotected eyes will blind an average being of
the universe. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @YThis bright yellow star is of average size. At this distance the heat from
the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so
intense that looking at it with unprotected eyes will blind an average being of
the universe. @n

   @YThis bright yellow star is of average size. At this distance the heat from
the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @YThis bright yellow star is of average size. At this distance the heat from
the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so
intense that looking at it with unprotected eyes will blind an average being of
the universe. @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

the star is withstandable for most ships. The light from the sun here is so

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

   @cA bright green planet with very little water can be seen far below. Few
clouds dot the mostly dry planet's sky. The intense green color the planet has
doesn't come from its atmosphere but from the rich deposits of crytals that
cover the surface of the planet. These crystals appear to reflect most solar
light from the nearby star back out into space. @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n

 @DThis dark void has very little light.  The light it does have comes from
distant astral bodies such as stars or planets.  Occasional clouds of gas,
asteroids, or comets can be seen.  Other than that it is empty blackness for
thousands upon thousands of miles in every direction.  @n
