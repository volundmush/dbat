Key Trolling
Someone is giving some of the limited spawn keys to mobs. Found 4 on Tina in
the appartment area on Earth. Please keep your eyes/ears open for info on
who's doing it.

Payback Request
Sublife has asked me to assist her with the paying back of a player RPP owed to
them. She isn't sure she's coming back / doesn't have easy access currently
etc. I've agreed because it's easy and asked her to send me a PM on the forums
so there's an official request. She's asking me to take 20RPP from her and
give it to Mirage as RPP Owed. In this case, I know Mirage was even mentioning
his generosity on DIscord, I figured helping with this would be a good show of
publicity for that.

Dehovin Level 3 points
Was for the moment told by Mirage that we were letting people progress to level
3 via point allotments. Mirage is reliable so I'm taking him for his word. 
Let me know if this is in error. @n

   I would like to schedule an immortal meeting for Saturday the 7th at 8pm, if
you can't make it let me know. Being present isn't absolutely required, but it
is required to have a voice on the final planned era changes.

Moved the time to 10pm due to schedule conflicts.

Re: Iovanplz. Stuffs to fix.
	@D------- @cQuoted message @D-------@w
Things that either NEED to happen, or *PROBABLY should happen:
1) Fix Bio-Androids
2) Fix Arlians
3) *Adjust Telepathy to incur a constant drain when linked, each action used by telepathy uses ki, farsight uses a large chunk.
4) Offensive abilities (most) need to be fixed due to targeting issues.
Anything beyond is TBD or added as-needed
just tossing up things that I'm more than certainly need to be fixed pre-pwipe. (asap)
	@D   ------- @cEnd Quote @D-------@w
Piccolo's masenko bonus (Masenko - SLVL 40 gains +3% of max ki to damage, SLVL 60 gains +5% of max ki, SLVL 100 gains +8% of max ki.) isn't applying the bonus, I've tested with characters of the same race, same stats, different senseis (one piccolo, one not) and there is no notable difference, even after having set their ki high enough to be guaranteed a difference at skill 100)

They both had 1b ki, the piccolo student was doing 126,913,506 damage, the non-piccolo student was doing 126,323,210 damage- 8% of 1b is 80m- that's most certainly not the difference.  It's low priority, but it's something that should be fixed.

Serious problems with 'lockout'
Hey all.

Your friendly "this is why we cant have nice things" guy here.

Iovan: Lower level immortals can lockout higher level immortals. It's hard to explain, but yeah. i2 locked out an i6.
Notice me senpai.

Bugs. Bugs everywhere.
1. Arlian evolutions not properly increased when evolving Ki or Stamina (except one used)
2. Targettable abilities (offensive focuses for example) aren't targetting properly, will only target most recent PC in room.
3. Android Augment Kits (the 80+ ones) yield gains exceptionally low, lower than upgrading naturally.
4. Bio-Android's extract isn't capped to stay on-par with other races.
5. Mobs assisting each other eventually break and yield unrewardable experience (Known, tied into next)
6. Spar Boosters proccing off of mob assist bug will reset players' experience.
7. Death penalty awards maximum time regardless of number of deaths.
8. Arlians evolving when above 50,000 armor have armor reset to 50,000.
9. Limbs regenerating after being destroyed at 0% (mob brings it from 100% to 0% where it's destroyed, regen tick brings it back into existence)

where you can actually reasonably make it. The time will be January 17th

@RIMMORTAL MEETING FOR REALSIES
   The immortal meeting will be at 10pm Saturday regardless of who is there
this time. The meeting log will be posted and any comments/complaints can be
posted to the thread that will have that log.

   Meeting will discuss plans for the next two months as we prepare for era 8,
getting the mud back into shape, addressing promotion/hiring/demotion concerns,
assigned duties (probably won't change too much for the higher imms, mostly
streamlining) and game balance/rule issues.

I'd like to hear any and all thoughts (please post it in reply form on the posts to make sure I see them) on these topics. I know a bunch of stuff in the ERP post has loopholes, and morality issues, which is why I'm really open to any and all thoughts on that. The main reason I wanted to change up the ERP rule is to give those people that want to ERP, and enjoy it, a way of getting points for doing what they enjoy without grossing anyone on the staff, or forcing someone that doesn't want to read it on the

Imms, RPP Bank, and you
The command to add and remove RPP from someones RPP Bank is 'rbank <target> <amount>'

 
Also, user files that first get updated get 1 RPP added to their banks, this will not happen with brand new users, so when you update someones bank you can either deduct 1 from the amount you enter, or decide to keep it as a free gift. Your call.
