Zone changes for Era 9
@yOrange Star @WHighschool@n
@G___________________________@n

   @W-@R Level balancing. Zone should now be viable for levels 10-30 at base, expanded area is 50-60.
   @W-@RZone Cleanup. Adjusted grammar, coloring and descriptions etc. for mobs and items.@n
   @W-@RTalisman Trigger re-written. This was very simple, so now players will be flagged the moment they kill the Follower. Any further attempts will load the replica, and the items themselves no longer load, they're dropped through the trigger to avoid stealing.@n

@WThe Moon@n
@G_________________________________@n

   @W-@RLevel balancing. Zone has been adjusted and now viable for 50-80ish on the level ranges, @WEXCLUDING@R the 100+ Mlvl mobs that stand out.@n
   @W-@RFinished the zone. Remaining Vnums were used to add in the FIB moon base, as well as the Lost temple of Samael (only denoted by the statue and the ambience).
   @W-@RZone cleanup. Adjusted grammar, coloring and descriptions etc. for mobs and items.@n
   @W-@ROnyx Ore item. This has been given to a new Onyx Golem, Mlvl set to be similar to the Sapphire golem. This for now is a cash item that can be sold, but is intended to be attached to a quest setup similar to the Fangol Blitz Bracer mid-era.@n

Dragons plus more
   I've changed the lizardfolk race into dragon race. If you have anything
built as a lizardfolk before you should probably change it to something else.
Dragons will have the fire breath attack open to them. I'll add other elements
eventually for them to breath out. Shadow Dragons, the wyverns on Yardrat, all
currently built dragons, and Bahamut are all now dragon type.

   I've also added in two other attacks for non-humanoid npcs to use. The
first is fang strike, which only serpents can use. The second is ram, which
any non-humanoid can use (rarely). Fang strike has a good chance to hit with a
bonus to bite's damage. Ram does a lot of damage with less of a chance to hit
and a good chance to bust up limbs.

NPC Skillsets
   Setting an NPC to the following classes will give them access to ki attacks
(such as kiblast) if they roll the chance to use a ki attack, as well as
special ki attacks if they roll high enough to do one.
 
Class             Skills  ( Least Likely to Fire -> Most Likely to Fire)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roshi - Kakusanha, Kienzan, Kamehameha, Barrier, Tier 1 and 2 ki attacks
Krane - Tribeam, Hasshuken, Dodonpa, Barrier, Tier 1 and 2
Bardock - Final Flash, Big Bang, Galik Gun, Barrier, Tier 1 and 2
Frieza - Deathball, Kienzan, Deathbeam, Barrier, Tier 1 and 2
Piccolo - Scatter Shot, Special Beam Cannon, Masenko, Barrier, Tier 1 and 2
Nail - Regenerate, Heal, Masenko, Zanzoken*, Tier 1 and 2
Sixteen - Hell Flash, Kousengan, Dual Beam, Barrier, Tier 1 and 2
Ginyu - Spiral, Crusher Ball, Eraser Cannon, Zanzoken*, Tier 1 and 2
Kurzak - Ensnare, Seishou Enko, Renzo, Barrier, Tier 1 and 2
Tsuna - Koteiru, Water Razor, Water Spikes, Barrier, Tier 1 and 2
Jinto - Star Nova, Star Breaker, Trip, Zanzoken*, Tier 1 and 2
Tapion - Phoenix Slash, Darkness Dragon Slash, Twin Slash, Zanzoken*, Tier 1 and 2
Kibito - Psychic Barrage, Psychic Blast, Heal, Zanzoken*, Tier 1 and 2
Dabura (Do not give to every demon!)- Hellspear, Honoo, Fireshield, Zanzoken*, Tier 1 and 2

   *: Tier 1 and 2 has a chance everytime to roll a zanzoken. This separate
zanzoken listing is an extra chance for a zanzoken (since normally a barrier
would be rolled if they have barrier where Zanzoken* is listed. )

   If an NPC is generally weak (level 10 or below) or a "normal" type of person
do not give them a class. Normal citizens should not have a class other than
commoner.

No Poison
   Added no poison mob flag to medit. This will make the mob immune to the
poison skill.

Scripts
A reference can be found here. It sure would be nice if someone could go through the site and copy most of this information down for us and place it on the staff's building section on the forum.

Newbie Quests
These senseis now have newbie quests:
Bardock
Roshi
Frieza
Ginyu
Krane
Sixteen
Piccolo

The other senseis already had quests, or didn't warrant them. The quest reward
is twofold. The item you get from the quest is edible, and can be gotten over
and over again. It only fills you up by 1, so it's a terrible food... But
it's something to prevent starving at the beginning and easy to obtain. Also,
when completing the quest... You get two Public Transport Tickets that you can
use to go to Namek to grav train and come back. The quest can only be
completed once, so you can't spam tickets from it.

Some minor changes to areas have been done in some spots. Notably, this means
signs have been put up directing noobs to the area the noob quest involves...
In the form of a street sign type thing. This was only done for some (some,
like frieza and the frozen fist dojo... You have no choice but to pass on your
way out, so you don't need signs... )

Pendelum Room Errors
Should be fixed. The trigger was being offset by an interestingly written
while statement so that when it detected the player, it set the variable to not
the player, but the previous run through of the script var.

Arlia Food Shop
Added a food shop to Arlia in zone 160 (room and shop vnum 16096). There was
already a food place there (known after the fact), but Sam didn't mind if it
stayed.

Gabriela's Resize Script
Gabriela's resize script had several errors in syntax, as well as an
inconsistency with what was written on the board. I copied the trigger to vnum
14791 and rewrote parts of the original (14790) to make it both accurate and
correct in syntax.

@R-@nPrice now accurately reflects 5% of the cost plus level of the item times 50
@R-@nThe say script had a percent sign in it, which aborted the rest of the say
after it, probably because it was looking for a variable.
@R-@nThe say information has been updated to let the player know the cost both on
failure and success.
