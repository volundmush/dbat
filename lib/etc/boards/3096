Lost City - Kanassa/Namek/Filler (Zone 76)
   Welcome to the Lost City! A zone meant to test the mightest of slayers,
hunters, and wrecker-of-shits alike. Tucked away in its own miniature
ecosystem, the land has had time to develop on its own and strange creatures
are filling the streets of once an early civilization. Discover the ruins
within, embrace the serenity of nature re-claimed, and meet with the legendary
monster hunter Martuku. 

   Martuku is there, following a lead on the most vicious of creatures- the 8
headed hydra. Said to have been the reason behind the fall of the city, the
monster lurks in the depths... 

   Originally meant to be the location of the skill 'Dark Metamorphosis', the
lost city is now open for interpretation. The planet tiles are easily changed,
so it can be fitted on any of the numerous planets we have. Earth, Konack,
Aether, Kanassa all work very easily for location. They're also connected to
the warp-pool network, so it makes sense as to why a Kanassan is there, hunting
a monstrosity. 

   Currently unfinished. Access given to any builder who asks, just get with
Gmork or Virtus. :)

   Currently the reward for defeating the hydra is a trophy, as DM has been
moved. I personally wouldn't mind replacing DM, or filling the area with other
trophy-related items that could quite possibly be worked into crafted gearsets,
similar to Griknaug's earrings and the like.
