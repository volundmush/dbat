Majin ingest
Ingest for majins now no longer tries to increase your ability in speaking common. Also, added a new variable to character struct, and new define. "ingestLearned" sets to 0 at chargen, is used by ingest learn to teach the majin 1 t3 ki skill known by the target, then sets ingestLearned to 1, disabling any future adding of new t3 skills.

@RImportant Coding Notice@n
   I want all coding projects to be recorded on this board, with any older than
four months being purged as necessary. Posts should cover the scope of a
project, its goal, and what will be changed (if applicable. ) Projects should
be updated via the board's respond command as needed (with a minimum of a post
detailing the completion of the project in question. )
 
   On that note I need to have a discussion with Virtus and our newest coder
about what is currently planned, because I plan on doing some things myself. 
I do not wish to step on any toes regarding what is planned or due to my
ignorance ruin something already changed. So you two please get with me ASAP
on when we can have a coder meeting.
