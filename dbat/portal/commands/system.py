    Display or reconfigure your client settings. Use this if your MUD client

            Displays current settings and details.

        client <setting>=<value>
            Sets a new setting.
    
    Settings and Values:
        width = <int>
            The width of the client display. default is 78.
        color = <none|ansi|xterm256|truecolor>
            The color mode for the client. default is ansi.
        encoding = <ascii|utf-8>
            The text encoding for the client. default is ascii.
            Enable utf-8 to see special characters and emojis.
            If your client doesn't support it, you may see garbage.
        screenreader = <on|off>
            Enable or disable screenreader mode. default is off.
            This exchanges visual aesthetics for cleaner text-to-speech.
            Please alert staff if something isn't accessible enough.
    
    Helpful Notes:
        different MUD clients have different quirks and capabilities.
        This game is programmed to work with many, but it prefers those
        that support TTYPE/MTTS, NAWS, xterm256 color, and UTF-8 encoding.
