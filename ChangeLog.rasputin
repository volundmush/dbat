	- (R) Updated guild_guard special procedure to better deal with
	  multiclass characters. 
	  Thanks cansian!
	- (R) Updated apply_ac to remove some dead weight, but though it

	  to display a shop with rooms that have been removed.
	- (C) Updated remove_player so that the players command would

	  are not used that way in CWG-Rasputin.

	  way too quickly.
	- (C) Added level-difference penalty for killing mobs below your level.
	- (C) Removed a straight /3 loss of EXP earned in combat. I

	- (R) Updated feats display so it is more informative for things

	  most of their key stats are generated by selecting their level.
	  Manually settings these key stats will toggle the AUTOBALANCE off.
	  The coder can then easily update the mob_autobalance function to
	  readjust/reset all AUTOBALANCED mobs on the next reboot/copyover.

	  so that this behavior could be supressed from a humanoid mob.

	- (B, R, S) I have changed all defalut port binding sockets. This is
	  mainly to allow me to run the pre-release versions on my cwg server
	  all at once.
	  CWG-Rasputin default port binding is 5001.
	  CWG-SunTzu default port binding is 5002.
	  CWG-Buddha default port binding is 5003.
	  I will exclude these changes from the next release patch, so no one
	  is accidently impacted. However, all new full downloads will behave
	  this way.
