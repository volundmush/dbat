Jun  6 17:13:51 :: @GTELL: @CSvyato@G tells @cObiie, @W'@wWell, they all said namek is the hardest, especially for new players.  Keeping that in mind, you should fair relatively decent outside of Namek.@W'@n

Mar 23 02:56:53 :: @GTELL: @CLentholium@G tells @cSamael, @W'@wwe almost had a new player. i think.@W'@n
Apr 17 04:46:24 :: @GTELL: @CMalenstro@G tells @cSamael, @W'@wnew players come here and get hooked on the combat an exploration aspects but some can't handle learning the rp curve I guess? @W'@n
May  6 23:12:03 :: @GTELL: @CSamael@G tells @cIfreat, @W'@wSo you are bullying two new players who you have absolutely no IC knowledge of in any connection? Classy.@W'@n
May 24 13:27:24 :: @GTELL: @CAsmodeus@G tells @cGazza, @W'@wI would say you help out the noobs the start on the game, make an appearance to all new players.. and answer all the questions you can@W'@n
Jun 28 22:59:11 :: @GTELL: @CMalenstro@G tells @cTyrael, @W'@wI think instant transmission should have a different lock on than sense...ki recognition or something? learnd at same trainer area after quest complete, have to sense 'ki' mob/player to trigger a flag that gives you access...so even after you get the skill you can't just take 800 saved ps to master instant transmission. Thus you still need to walk everywhere at least once more, as well as meet new players@W'@n
Jul 13 16:25:59 :: @GTELL: @CTyrael@G tells @cLentholium, @W'@wSend me a mud mail or pm with what you want me to mention, or you can post it yourself if you want it up now, but we are gonna be initiating a *get new players* plan@W'@n

Jun 27 23:03:16 :: @GTELL: @CGazza@G tells @cDiz, @W'@wyour super good, first new player to even get close to 100... so yeah, your doing real good, took me till like the end of the second era to get to 100 cuz i was so newbie lol@W'@n
Jul  1 12:19:41 :: @GTELL: @CLentholium@G tells @cHiro, @W'@woh, i removed it because sam muted me for it. I presume he was annoyed and didnt want any more new players.@W'@n

May 27 16:45:28 :: @GTELL: @CHanyo@G tells @cBuddha, @W'@wWe should coordinate now. >.> Our new players need to see better eventing than this.@W'@n
May 29 10:43:23 :: @GTELL: @CThavius@G tells @cMadHatter, @W'@wAs you know Hanyo and I are friends in real life and I seriously try not to put him a situation where he has a conflict of interests so I can not go to him about what I see. All he would likely do is defend, deflect and in the end do nothing because he does not want to jeopardize being an IMM. He takes that very seriously as he should. The notion i got from him is if peopl ehave issue they can jsut rage quit which suggests the issues I see are known but nothing is done about it and if new players don't like it they can just 'ragequit' as he put it.@W'@n
Jun  7 21:30:43 :: @GTELL: @CAntares@G tells @cSet, @W'@wNo promises.  I cannot abide people like him. Not only does the belittle everyone else's opinions, and seem to think he's never wrong.  but he does it willfully and for no other porpose than to piss peope off. More importantly he's been feeding new player some just plain *BAD* info. and scareing off other players with his better-than-thou additude.@W'@n

Aug 10 16:48:17 :: @GTELL: @CMadHatter@G tells @cShinrar, @W'@wone of these is the City Square on Earth. Normally this type of information is prohibited, but we like to help the new players.@W'@n
Jun  9 18:43:50 :: @GTELL: @CGinju@G tells @cDemon, @W'@wBoat I had to make sure I didn't offend some new player.@W'@n
Jun 14 08:36:01 :: @GTELL: @CThavius@G tells @cBuddha, @W'@wwe ahve a new core of players that came in since the era started. I would say we do not need more players we need better interaction with/between the players we have. Things should be getting built and that means we are abuot to flex and grow as a game. after we do that, then we can focus on new players. I have a few places we can advertise without issue. A few friends run MMORP forum boards. From eq2,WoW, to star wars that should let us advertise if i talk to them@W'@n

Sep 27 15:41:06 :: @GTELL: @CLonewuelf@G tells @cVirtus, @W'@wAnd these new players are a great source of it too, haha. Plus you get to teach them how to RP and the cycle continues!@W'@n

Apr 27 16:19:08 :: @GTELL: @CTepsih@G tells @cCerberus, @W'@wcan you do me a favor? there's a log up under lihai, new player, there's a saiyan in it i -think- might be you but there's no dub and they dont remember. could you check it real quick and see if that's kaz talking?@W'@n
Jun  7 15:36:15 :: @GTELL: @CCerberus@G tells @cTetujin, @W'@wall seriousness, if you want help training up the ones I gave you advice on before, I'm willing to help but you'll have to ask IC :( I like helping new players but won't breach IC/OOC.@W'@n
Jun 10 13:44:59 :: @GTELL: @CCerberus@G tells @cTetujin, @W'@wIt's no worry. new players means more RP means more RP for me :) I'm always happy to help.@W'@n
Jun 10 16:32:32 :: @GTELL: @CTepsih@G tells @cTetujin, @W'@wyou can write solos off mud. we like them to be filtered through the mud usually but a couple times of not doing so is fine, especially for new players@W'@n
Jun 11 16:37:05 :: @GTELL: @CTepsih@G tells @cTetujin, @W'@wi -can- be agressive, no doubt about it. i honestly don't think that they don't like you, they just don't know how to talk with you yet :/ honestly i think a lot of us are nervous with new players because we really don't want to offend but half the time we do@W'@n

Jun 16 16:29:45 :: @GTELL: @CKabumpe@G tells @cLacrimosa, @W'@wHi! Sorry to bother you again, uh, I heard new players get 75 RPP?@W'@n
Aug 12 18:57:49 :: @GTELL: @CCypher@G tells @cKairys, @W'@wWe gave each account 75 rpp this era. This includes new players. Do witht hem what you wish, only ask that you do not give the bulk of them to other players. @W'@n
Dec 21 21:55:29 :: @GTELL: @CVirtus@G tells @cStar, @W'@wThat's for joining this era. Everyone gets it, new players and old alike. It's because the previous era was rather short.  Either way.  Welcome!@W'@n
Aug 30 11:40:05 :: @GTELL: @CSorenthaz@G tells @cLiadan, @W'@wThe funny thing is that most of the players who were like that actually ran off the moment they weren't able to stock up RPP between eras in order to cruise to level 100 and get huge advantages against new players.@W'@n
Aug 30 11:49:54 :: @GTELL: @CLiadan@G tells @cSorenthaz, @W'@wIt's a proven cycle: new players retained -> more rp partners -> new players attracted. Fewer RP partners is going to mean less fun for everyone until people decide to spend their time elsewhere.@W'@n
Aug 30 11:53:48 :: @GTELL: @CSorenthaz@G tells @cLiadan, @W'@wAdmittedly it's really easy to fall into RPing with a handful of people based on allegiances and so on ICly, or even OOCly based on who you have more fun RPing with.  And as a new player it can be intimidating to walk up into RPs or people who are significantly stronger than you.   But yeah inclusion is a real issue.@W'@n
Dec 19 22:02:46 :: @GTELL: @CSeraph@G tells @cSilver, @W'@wYou have a right to an opinion Silver, and I'm not here to pick a fight. I get you're still new and have experience in other MUDs but that doesn't give much cause to speak out against the creator of this wonderful game like that. I'm only asking that you keep the snarky comments to a minimun so we don't chase off new players. Believe it or not our PB isn't that small. It's just in a constant flux.@W'@n

Feb  8 00:01:47 :: @GTELL: @CSuzumebachi@G tells @cYezrah, @W'@wAction will be taken if it happens again. We do not wish to push away new players by any means. Mirage has been trying to help you, but most of your problems thus far, have been failure to read. Reading info displayed in rooms, reading mud rules, reading the mud school. Just slow down, take your time, and you'll get it :)@W'@n

May 14 19:40:17 :: @GTELL: @CSorenthaz@G tells @cItheria, @W'@wWell he was basically a brand new character who didn't even get a biography out and got jumped by a Majin attacking him solely because of his race choice.  Like to him it looked like someone camping a newbie area and jumping on new players that made Saiyan Halfies.@W'@n

Mar  8 14:46:19 :: @GTELL: @CVolund@G tells @cRosemar, @W'@wremember that I said I was playing a Bardock-Halfie? The image that I, a new player had of the experience, is that I should be brutally beating shit down with sheer force. However, the Flying With Guns or using skills like yoikominminken are 10x more efficient. The former is an exploit that's accepted by the community specifically because it's Too Convenient because other ways are Too Hard. (And, paradoxically, you can't do this with ki attacks.)@W'@n
Mar  8 14:48:42 :: @GTELL: @CVolund@G tells @cRosemar, @W'@wand a new player sure as hell doesn't know which mobs will make scouters explode.@W'@n
Mar  8 14:50:44 :: @GTELL: @CVolund@G tells @cRosemar, @W'@wThis game is full of little design flaws that all amount to a HUGE MOUNTAIN OF FRUSTRATIONS to anyone who doesn't know how to avoid them. And the oldbies, who've gotten used to dodging them, forget they exist and say that new players just don't get it.@W'@n
May 16 20:03:32 :: @GTELL: @CAdelsin@G tells @cForrest, @W'@wOr the mentor and the new player RP doesn't mesh?@W'@n
May 16 20:15:07 :: @GTELL: @CAdelsin@G tells @cForrest, @W'@wAnother option is that new players get a slight bonus when grouped or sparring against their mentor@W'@n
May 16 20:16:43 :: @GTELL: @CAdelsin@G tells @cForrest, @W'@wThen, add rewards to the mentor the more active the new player plays, such as reaching certain levels and RP more.@W'@n
