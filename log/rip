Oct 19 16:12:58 :: @GTELL: @CShinrar@G tells @cRosemar, @W'@wThere is a difference between having a poor attitude towards the way things are run, and having good sportsmanship in a debate.  My problem is, you're complaining about how an event is run.  There should be zero reason to complain about that.  If you don't like events, don't partisipate.  Maybe it's because I'm used to playing a game where the main focus of events is to see how many players you can get killed, and we still play - because we have a blast fighting for our lives, and RPing.  If you don't enjoy tournements, then don't join them.  I walked in thinking I was the weakest character there.  I beat two people, and almost netted second place.@W'@n

Feb 28 20:00:53 :: @GTELL: @COnasaki@G tells @cKaiya, @W'@wThe difference is Freiza had a reason. He was afraid of the Saiyans. He wanted the dragonballs. He didn't kill people just to kill them, he killed them to make an example, and to cause fear. The instance I speak of, there was no real RP that happened. The dude just killed someone to kill them.@W'@n
Feb 28 20:04:32 :: @GTELL: @CKaiya@G tells @cOnasaki, @W'@w...and the one instance I've seen of someone getting semi-randomly killed was because the guy had insulted the Saiyans (and halfbreeds, I guess) whose players were online, and they were going to punish him for merely saying that. He threw some deterrence, they persisted, PKing ensued.@W'@n
Feb 28 20:14:03 :: @GTELL: @CKaiya@G tells @cOnasaki, @W'@wTelling it with his permission. There was a guy on here a while ago, dunno if you were around at the same time as he was, who had a tendency to rant about IRL things, like his laundry washer catching fire (which was ranted about -while it was still on fire-). He had a lot of anger issues, and trying to comfort him would just make him angry at you. One day he eventually flipped out and said 'fuck it, going to kill people, don't care what happens'. First person he saw happened to be Demon's character, and Demon was AFK at the time. Punched Demon's character, punched again, got parried and one-hit-killed on the second hit, completely lost it.@W'@n

Aug 12 12:32:00 :: @GTELL: @CCerberus@G tells @cSarason, @W'@wit's there, it just gets overshadowed. Forbidden sees it as acceptable because of all the tension and stuff that's always in the air. People think me and thavius get down on some animosity because of the RP tension. No. We skype while we write that shit. But stuff like Demon and whatnot that bleeds out so in that respect that's my fault but what I'm supposed to do? Sit there and just not try to fix it? I'm supposed to ignore the things I'm seeing? No. Unfortunately, that tension creates a blanket of agression that's always prevelant it would seem. But interestingly enough, the things I hear via skype and the conversations I have are things like : I dislike the metaplot because it only seems aimed at level 100's. That's only because nobody is working the metaplot and so the only references are to us from way back in the beginning. Things like Forbidden. It's damn near not even his fault.

Sep 17 22:46:43 :: @GTELL: @CSorenthaz@G tells @cManarath, @W'@wHey Mana.  I'd like to deeply apologize for how immaturely I behaved OOCly (and ICly for that matter) on Thursday with pretty much bombing that scene and then running off.  Was in a bad mood OOCly and pretty much let that take the wheel for how my character decided to behave ICly over SNET and then on Icer, realized /way/ too late that I was essentially destroying what little my character was trying to build back up, backed myself into my own corner, and kind of just panicked and mentally shut down from that to where I just wanted to get killed so I wouldn't have to worry about the era anymore due to ruining my character and making him say/do things he wouldn't have normally said/done ICly.  So yeah... idk what's happened since then or how you've two decided to treat it (preferably I wish it'd just be completely nulled and act like Sukallion simply /didn't/ antagonize Melody after she told him not to be concerned with it, because that's what he /would/ have done, but bleh I can live with it if I have to).  Melody removed/blocked me from all forms of communication so I can't even apologize to her or talk about it.  So if you want to pass this on to her go ahead.  Sorry again for crashing a scene I had no business crashing, only to derail it and then run off when  I pretty much lost it.  -.-@W'@n

I've said this a couple of times, that I decided months ago that her attempt at the throne was my character's story climax. Kinda in the same way that Marissa had set it up so that if she was killed to kill Amon it was permanent. I decided months ago that if she lost yet another attempt on her world it would break her. Having your life ruined three times is a bit much for anyone. Lol, I'm ok here, it's just the end of the story is all. I didn't wait this long to try to take the world because of others, but because if I had done it months ago I'd have ended my story prematurely.@W'@n

Pacifists are really good at controlling that anger so ... the first SSJ should be hard for him. FPSSJ (assuming it's not also a random and is now tied to say time spent in SSJ or number of enemies killed in SSJ etc etc etc etc etc etc ad blah) inversely should be purdy easy to get a hold on in theory at some point. SO much to do so little time. @W'@n

Apr  4 03:05:43 :: @GTELL: @CJess@G tells @cHobben, @W'@wand it would stack, so if you got killed twice by it you would take 100% more damage. so let's say a random mob kills you, you go back to kill it, but you take more damage. this'd punish bad play by people who think immortality is a be-all end-all.@W'@n

When I was very young, We were chased from Vegetos City because I was born ... less. Mute, traits of diluted breeding my father explained to me. My hair most of all. People were killed in the mob and trampled and my faher chose to leave his only home and way of life to teach me a better one. I've lived on Konack, Namek, Earth. We even stayed on one of the outer colonies for a small time, working a very specific job when I was maybe ten. He was determined to show me that strength can be channeled into the creation of great and beautiful things. It doesn't have to destroy. I believe this, and hold to it. Just because I AM strong doesn't mean I'm destined to be a warrior, or a monster.@W'@n

May 14 19:35:33 :: @GTELL: @CSorenthaz@G tells @cItheria, @W'@wBut I can understand why he'd get uppity.  And he wasn't necessarily wrong with some of his assessments -in my opinion- but he didn't seem to understand that there was a healing tank literally two rooms east of him that Manarath was probably sitting in.   Mana could've maybe been nice to a newcomer and moved to one of the other gravity spots that has a htank nearby, but the guy freaking out and taking it to OOC just killed any chances of that happening.  @W'@n
